<p class="pn center p4 elarge">THE BOY SCOUTS OF<br />LAKEVILLE HIGH</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE NEW BOY</p>


<p class="pn p2">"Help!"</p>

<p>As though snipped off short by one of its own whirling
blades, the lawn mower in the next yard stilled
abruptly. Almost on the echo, a mop of red hair
popped above the garden fence.</p>

<p>From her perch on the turning-pole, which jutted
out of the big butternut tree in the Sefton back lawn,
Molly Sefton watched the brick-red thatch and the
serious face beneath it. She wondered whether the
boy were fifteen years old or sixteen, and whether these
new neighbors who had moved in only the day before
would prove as "nice" as she had found the rest of
the little village of Lakeville. Then a sharp twist of
pain made her forget everything except her right foot.</p>

<p>"Please help me loose," she called. "I was climbing
up to get my kitten, and my foot slipped in here.
Now I can't get it out."</p>

<p>By this time, the red-headed boy had drawn himself
to the top of the fence. Almost before she had finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
explaining, he had dropped on the other side. Scrambling
up to the horizontal bar beside her, he squinted
thoughtfully at the imprisoned foot, wedged between
the tree-trunk and the wooden strip that held the end
of the bar.</p>

<p>"Pull your foot straight up."</p>

<p>She made the effort and winced. "It's too tight."</p>

<p>The red-headed boy frowned. "You're wearing
thick, outdoor shoes," he said. "If I just unlace this
one, you can wiggle your foot out as easy as pie."</p>

<p>While she remained standing on the bar, balancing
herself by the tree, the boy straddled the pole and began
switching the shoe lace out of the stops.</p>

<p>"It was my kitten I wanted to get," she said slowly.
"That's how it happened. And he's up there yet."</p>

<p>The red head looked up. Two feet out of the girl's
reach, clinging to a tiny limb, hung a black and white
kitten. From time to time, it opened its mouth and let
out a whimpering cry that sounded like "<i>Me-e-e!</i>"</p>

<p>"How did it get up there?"</p>

<p>"The Claxton's dog pretty nearly scared it to death;
it started climbing and was afraid to stop."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded the boy. "Well, you jerk your
foot out of that shoe, and we'll get the kitten easy
enough. Are you all ready? Now!"</p>

<p>Molly made the effort to free herself.</p>

<p>"I can't!"</p>

<p>"It's just as easy as falling&mdash;if you'll only try."</p>

<p>"It's not easy." She was beginning to lose her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
temper. "I'm stuck just as fast as I ever was.
You haven't done a bit of good." Before she finished
the sentence, she was ashamed of her words, for a hurt
look overspread the face beneath the red hair.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can't yank it free?"</p>

<p>"I know I can't."</p>

<p>Very deliberately, he bent down and pulled from his
own right foot the white tennis slipper.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't get you loose, but I know how
to get your kitten down."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Without answering, he drew back his slipper in a
position to hurl it at the helpless kitten. He measured
the distance with his eye, poising the shoe for the
most accurate throw possible.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what are you going to do?" She was
very close to screaming.</p>

<p>"Hold tight. That kitten might come down right
on your head."</p>

<p>"You horrid, <i>horrid</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll count three slowly, and if your foot isn't out
by that time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mustn't do such a thing! You
shan't!" Molly gasped her indignation, meanwhile
clinging to the tree with both hands.</p>

<p>"Just the same, I'm going to. Get your arm out
of the way."</p>

<p>He pulled back his tennis slipper to aim at the kitten.
"One!&mdash; Two!&mdash; Thr&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>A little half-scream interrupted him, and behold!
Molly's stockinged foot rested beside its booted mate as
she lunged forward to prevent the outrage upon the
little black and white kitten.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the red-headed boy was merely
grinning good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I knew you could," he said. "I knew, if you really
wanted to&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a little moment, Molly stared sternly at him, before
she bit her lower lip with an expression that was
somewhere between vexation and relief.</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I don't believe you meant to throw your
slipper at all," she reproved him.</p>

<p>With a little broader grin, he nodded his head
frankly.</p>

<p>"Of course, I didn't. I wouldn't throw anything
at your kitten any more than I'd throw anything at
ours, and we've got an awfully funny little fellow. All
I wanted to do was to get your foot loose." Molly
smiled in spite of herself. "Now, if you'll get down
on the ground, so I can shinny up the tree a bit, I'll
catch the kitten, and then I'll get that shoe of yours."</p>

<p>With her stockinged foot cushioned on the soft grass,
Molly watched the boy struggle up the tree and clumsily
but gently rescue the kitten from its roost. Afterwards,
when the animal lay safely in Molly's arms, he
pried loose the shoe from its wedged nook and dropped
a bit heavily, to the ground.</p>

<p>"It was splendid of you!" Molly began, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
stopped, horror-struck. "But look at your clothes!"</p>

<p>The red-headed boy glanced down, but continued to
smile, in spite of the dark stains that had spread where
he gripped the tree-trunk and sundry leaf and nut clusters
between his knees.</p>

<p>"I'm always doing something like that. I wish it
wasn't the first day of school, though," he added a little
ruefully. "It's most schooltime, too."</p>

<p>But now Molly was her practical self once more.
"You get your books," she ordered, "and I'll take
you down in our automobile. Horace Hibbs (he's an
inventor with the Fair Play Factory) has his workshop
near the school, and he mixes a sort of patent stuff that
just takes any kind of a spot out of your clothes. He's
the Scout Master of the Black Eagle Patrol of Boy
Scouts, too. See, father's getting the car ready now.
You come right over."</p>

<p>While Mr. Sefton drove the car, Molly and the red-headed
boy sat side by side on the rear seat. After
deftly finding out his name (which was Rodman Cree)
and his age (fifteen) and his grade (first-year high)
Molly began telling him all about Lakeville and about
the new high school, which had resulted from the
combined efforts of Horace Hibbs, the Fair Play Sporting
Goods Factory, and, most of all, the Black Eagles,
Lakeville's patrol of Boy Scouts.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"I came pretty near being a Scout last year myself,"
Rodman said suddenly. "I was all ready to pass my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
tenderfoot examinations when we moved out on a farm
and staid there till we came to Lakeville."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's fine!" Molly assured him briskly.
"You'll be taken in with the Black Eagles. You
see, Handy Wallace moved to Beloit almost a year ago,
and Sandy Anvers was sent East to school; so that
leaves only seven. And the patrol is going to do things
this year," she went on warmly. "There will be high-school
football teams and baseball and basketball teams
and everything else, and there will be lots of Black
Eagles on every team, too. I just know so."</p>

<p>The boy's face lost its smile. "I'm not sure whether
I'd be taken into that bunch or not," he confessed
slowly. "I'm not much good at athletics."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course you are!" nodded Molly reassuringly.
"And, besides, even if you aren't, you'd
be good in just a little while. You only have to try."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd like to," he agreed, as the car stopped in
front of the Fair Play Factory's annex. "I'd certainly
like to."</p>

<p>A round, jolly face showed at the window to the right
of the door, and presently Horace himself, Scout Master
of the Black Eagle Patrol, middle-aged and good-natured,
greeted him from the entrance.</p>

<p>"What can we do for you this morning, Mr. Sefton?"
smiled the inventor. "Do you want to buy a
pair of skates or some hockey sticks, or shall you wait
for the cold weather?"</p>

<p>Molly's father laughed. "We have a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
here who has been climbing a butternut tree, and Molly
tells me you own a special brand of stain remover that
can handle even accidents like this one."</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs raised his right hand. "Don't say
another word. We will send those stains to the Happy
Hunting Ground in about two minutes."</p>

<p>By the time Rodman Cree came back to the waiting
car, not only was his clothing free from the blemish of
the butternut, but his wish to join the Boy Scouts had
grown from a very moderate desire to one truly giant-sized.
Never before, he thought, had he met anybody
who understood boys as did Horace Hibbs; and what
the Scout Master told him about the patrol made him
wish that he knew scouting from A to Z, and, in addition,
could run the hundred in ten seconds, and broad-jump
across a river.</p>

<p>"Of course he's fine," agreed Molly, "but just wait
till you know the boys in the patrol&mdash;Bunny Payton,
the patrol leader, and Bi and Nap and S. S. and Jump
and Specs and Roundy; and, oh, just wait till you've
seen our new high school!"</p>

<p>Up Elm Street the car turned, and down Freemont,
pulling to a stop in the middle of the block.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Molly.</p>

<p>Artistically centered in a big lot, the building stood,
with a scrub ball game already in progress on the new
diamond. The gray rock side walls, that seemed to be
more window than anything else; the graceful lines
that rose in exquisite proportion; the main door, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
its roofed, stone-pillared veranda on each side,&mdash;all
made a structure that savored more of a home than a
school. It was the sort of place you would enjoy going
to, if the teachers only lived halfway up to the building.
And the crowd of pupils already gathering for the
first day proved how deeply Lakeville's first and only
high school had stirred the little village and the country
roundabout.</p>

<p>As Molly looked over the young people grouped at
the door or watching the game of "work-up," she
recognized not only every Lakeville boy and girl of
high school age, but as many more from farms and
villages within ten miles. By automobiles, by train,
a-wheel and on pony-back, they had gathered for the
opening session. Peter Barrett, his patched suit neatly
brushed and pressed, stood by his father's farm wagon;
ten yards away, Royal Sheffield, son of the wealthy,
real estate man of Charlesboro, was just climbing from
a new eight-cylinder car. "Buck" Claxton, who for
the past two years had worked at the local flour mill,
was playing a noisy game at first base, while on the
side-lines, Clarence Prissler, his nose out of a book for
once, was explaining the fine points of the sport to
Marion Genevieve Chester, who tilted her nose,
smoothed her hair, and looked very bored.</p>

<p>But the Boy Scouts of the Black Eagle Patrol were
neither watching from the side-lines nor bored. Heart
and soul, they were playing the game, from Specs McGrew,
taking a lead off third, to Bunny Payton, thumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the palm of his catching glove with his other hand
and signaling to Bi Jones, out in the pitcher's box.
Handling the bat itself, Roundy Magoon waved the
stick back and forth, while Bi, with maddening slowness,
made ready to pitch.</p>

<p>"Hurry it up!" shouted Bunny. "This fellow is
as good as gone, and I want a crack at the ball before
the bell rings."</p>

<p>Herbert Zane, whose nickname of "Spick and Span"
had been shortened to "S. S.", was creeping as far off
first as he dared, with an occasional glance at his
clothes, as if wondering whether or not it would pay
to risk the gorgeousness of a brand new suit by sliding
into second.</p>

<p>"Let the next one go!" he called to Roundy, apparently
having made up his mind that it would be better
to wallow in the dust, and thus perch on second, than
be forced out or made the victim of a double play.</p>

<p>Roundy nodded. Very likely, too, he intended to do
just that thing. But the ball floated over so slowly, so
tantalizing "right", that at the very last instant he
swung hard enough to drive it over all the roofs of
Lakeville. But Bi had put his muscle into the heave,
and Roundy had started his swing a fraction of a
second too late. Though all his stout body went into
the blow, only the handle of the bat made connection,
and the ball hit in front of the plate and dribbed toward
first.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Bunny leaped forward, scooped it up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
tagged Roundy before that slow-moving youth had
stirred into full action, and, with a bluff toward Specs,
pegged to second.</p>

<p>It was a good throw, although high, and Jump Henderson
took it with one of his old circus leaps, touching
S. S., who slid nobly but too late, and relaying the ball
back to Bunny in time to prevent Specs from making an
attempt to score.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me! I'm nobody!" Specs howled
mournfully, scampering back to third; while Roundy
and S. S. trotted out to the field, Buck Claxton stepped
into the pitcher's box, Nap Meeker put on the catcher's
glove, and Bi and Bunny came in to bat.</p>

<p>"Leave me here," wailed Specs. "That's right!
Leave me here! I'm having a lot of fun on this base.
Yes, I am! I've watched eight of you fan or hit pop-ups
or easy grounders; and here I am waiting yet."</p>

<p>"You won't be there long, Specs," Bunny promised
cheerfully, picking up the bat.</p>

<p>"That's what they all say," Specs growled. "But
nobody brings me in."</p>

<p>"Nobody will bring you in, either, old socks," observed
Nap. "You're licked in this war. All right,
Buck. Give him one right here."</p>

<p>The ball was shoulder high. Too eager to wait for
a good one, Bunny swung lustily, managing to foul it
off over Nap's head, past the Sefton automobile and
across the road, where the ball lodged under the high
fence of the Anvers yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell my folks to send my dinner out here," groaned
Specs, plumping himself down on third base and burying
his head between his knees.</p>

<p>It was just as Nap started after the lost ball that
Bunny spied the car with Molly and Rodman in the rear
seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bunny!" shouted Molly.</p>

<p>A moment later, the new boy and the leader of the
Black Eagles had formally shaken hands.</p>

<p>"And he can pass the tenderfoot tests, and he's
awfully good at athletics, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm not <i>any</i> good at athletics," protested Rodman,
laughing. "I'm no good at all in that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"He's just too modest to say so. You ought to
have seen how he saved the kitten."</p>

<p>"Have you ever played baseball?" demanded Bunny
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;a little. But I'm no good. I can't bat
decently, or catch or field."</p>

<p>Bunny held out his bat. "Come on over and take
my place," he invited. "I doubt if I can hit Buck, and
poor old Specs has been perched on third for hours.
Everybody who comes to bat knocks a baby grounder
or a pop-up or something, and Specs stays right there."</p>

<p>"All right, Bunny!" Nap broke in, crossing back to
the school yard with the ball.</p>

<p>Molly dropped her hand on Rodman's arm. "Go
and try," she urged. "I know you can do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry up, Bunny! Pretty near time for the bell!"
Nap flung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Rodman was plainly wavering. "But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Try it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must!" Molly commanded.</p>

<p>The new boy climbed out of the car, smiling. "I'm
no good, but I'll give you a chance to see just how bad
I am."</p>

<p>"This Claxton," Bunny confided, as they jogged to
the diamond, "pitches a hard ball, and he has a sure-enough
out-curve; but if you stand up to the plate and
don't let him bluff you back, it will be all right. Remember,
though, you have only two strikes left."</p>

<p>From the car, Molly watched Rodman and Bunny
join the others. For a little while, there seemed to be
some objection to Rodman's substituting, but Buck
Claxton ended the argument.</p>

<p>"Let him come to bat," observed Buck loudly. "He
can't hit. I can see it in his eye."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he can't," assented Specs sadly. "None of
'em can."</p>

<p>Rodman touched the plate with his bat. Buck wound
up with an exaggerated movement to deliver the pitch.
It was a hard, straight ball, with just the hint of a drop
in it, but the bat met it over the very center of the plate.</p>

<p><i>Spang!</i></p>

<p>The ball was off like a shot; off and up and over the
fielder's head in center, till it struck a tree twenty yards
beyond and rolled and bounded to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Specs loafed in from third, and before the fielder had
finished juggling with the ball, the red-headed boy had
rounded the three bases and touched home. Then,
while Specs was slapping Rodman on the back, and a
little scattered applause was rising from the crowd,
the school bell added its share to the celebration.</p>

<p>"He's a dandy!" chuckled Bunny enthusiastically,
as Molly met him hurrying to the building. "He's
going to be a Black Eagle, all right."</p>

<p>"Won't that be fine!" agreed Molly, quite as pleased
as though she were a Scout herself.</p>

<p>And that was the way the new-comer to Lakeville
High School&mdash;the new high school that would never
have been built if it had not been for the Black Eagle
Patrol&mdash;began his first day.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">TRACK TROUBLE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Before the end of the first lap, Rodman Cree had
quit. It could hardly be called his fault, because the
elastic waistband which held up his running pants had
snapped, and a further awkward gallop with his hands
holding up the slipping garment proved futile. So he
veered off the track.</p>

<p>"No use!" he laughed. "Besides, I'm not a runner,
anyhow."</p>

<p>It was the laugh that brought the scowl to Spec's
face. "Of course, it was not his fault," he grunted,
"but why does he laugh about it? He's running for
us to-day; he's our eighth man in the patrol. Doesn't
he understand that we want to win?"</p>

<p>It had been rather a last-minute affair, this field day
between the Black Eagles and Buck Claxton's team,
which he had called the All-School; and it was Specs
who had quite unconsciously started it all.</p>

<p>"I guess everybody knows," Specs had said in a
loud, clear voice during the first morning's recess, "who
it was that made this school possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't!" snapped Buck Claxton. "Look here,
if you Scouts think you're so much, I'll get together
eight fellows who can beat you at baseball or football
or track or anything else."</p>

<p>Though Bunny wished that Specs had spoken a little
more modestly and in a great deal lower voice, he was
not altogether sorry that the field meet had been arranged.
Because a half-holiday had been declared,
to enable the Citizens' Club of Elkana to inspect the
new high school building, it was on Tuesday morning
that the Scouts (plus Rodman Cree, to round out the
eight mentioned in the challenge) clashed with the All-School
team on field and track.</p>

<p>It was Bunny's idea that the field day might spread
the Scout movement among the new fellows of the
school, and especially among the following that Buck
Claxton was rapidly acquiring. The leader of the
Black Eagles felt, moreover, that they had been too
much by themselves, and that a second patrol would
not only wake them out of their clannishness, but that,
in addition, it would keep them from sleeping on their
laurels. And, of course, it was a splendid chance to see
what they could do when pitted against boys slightly
older and larger.</p>

<p>"That was some race!" chuckled Specs, after S. S.
had broken the tape. He and Bunny were walking
toward the competitors for the high jump. "Buck
ran a good race, even if he was nosed out. How about
taking him into the Black Eagle Patrol? He's crazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to get in, all right, no matter what he says. How do
you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Rodman Cree? He's
acting as our eighth man to-day. Seems to me he
should have first chance to join the patrol."</p>

<p>Specs wrinkled his forehead. "Y&mdash;yes. Oh, of
course, he's all right. But he says himself that he just
hit the ball by mistake yesterday morning; and you saw
what happened just now in the half-mile."</p>

<p>Bunny threw back his shoulders. "I don't care
whether Rodman Cree is any good at athletics or not.
He's the right kind of a fellow; that's the main thing.
Anyhow, I think he is. Besides, he may make good
at one of these other events."</p>

<p>But wherever his abilities lay, it was plain that the
red-headed boy had not been cut out by nature for a
high jumper. Others skimmed the bar as lightly as
swallows, but at the very outset Rodman began to
flounder and fail. Twice, at three feet, he knocked off
the crosspiece; the third time he came down on it
squarely, smashing the wood to flinders.</p>

<p>"I'm no high-jumper, I guess," he laughed, as he
quit the line of contestants. "I seem to be a pretty
good faller&mdash;only there's no falling race."</p>

<p>While Specs frowned his disapproval, Bunny tried
to hearten Rodman with a word of encouragement; for
it seemed to him that under the boy's good nature there
was a raw, sore spot.</p>

<p>"Don't you care!" he encouraged. "Before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
morning's over, you will find that you're good at some
one of these events. Besides, Jump will take care of
first place here."</p>

<p>Jump did. To top this win, Bunny finished first in
the hundred-yard dash, and, a little later, in the two-twenty.
It was not till the discus throw that the
Scout team suffered an overwhelming reverse. This
defeat was the more disappointing because Bi and
Roundy had counted on scoring points for first and
second between them. But in spite of Bi's efforts and
Roundy's weight, an All-School boy by the name of
Bob Kiproy proved that he had the knack of discus
throwing and that Bi hadn't. And Peter Barrett, the
farmer boy, without any form at all, managed to land
the platter-shaped weight some twenty-six inches beyond
Roundy's best. As for Rodman Cree, his throws
went woefully wild.</p>

<p>Now followed the most extraordinary event of the
morning.</p>

<p>"You can't throw the discus," Specs said maliciously
to Roundy. "You've proved that. Now, why don't
you go in and win this hurdle race?"</p>

<p>"All right," snapped the late weight-thrower.
"Just to prove that I can, I will."</p>

<p>It was the 120-yard course, with low hurdles, however,
instead of the customary thirty-six-inch regulation
barriers.</p>

<p>"Don't make a show of yourself," whispered Specs,
as Roundy lined up for the start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wasn't joking," retorted Roundy. "You
watch!"</p>

<p>And, to the surprise of everybody, it was Roundy
who breasted the tape first. While the others were
rushing frantically at the hurdles and falling as they
tripped and blundered, Roundy took his obstacles
"high and handsome," to use the words of Horace
Hibbs. Jump, who should have done well in this
event, hurt his knee at the fourth hurdle, where he
was forced out of the race.</p>

<p>"Attaboy!" exulted Specs, clapping Roundy on the
back. "I knew you could do it."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't, either," Roundy answered, too
pleased with his performance to be angry at anybody.
"But I won the five points all right, even if I'm not
one of you light and airy speedsters. What's next?"</p>

<p>The shot put was won by Bi, and, as Specs put it,
"lost by Mister Rodman Cree," who finished a bad
last.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving now," Bi told Bunny, after that event.
"Date with the dentist at eleven, as I explained. Before
I go, though, I'd just like to say that I don't think
this new fellow is any good. He can't run. Well,
that's all right. But he can't do anything else, either."</p>

<p>"This isn't a secret society, Bi, and it isn't an athletic
club. It's a patrol of Boy Scouts. And if Rodman
isn't good at some of these things that don't really
count, I know he's worth while in other ways."</p>

<p>Bi shook his head. "Let some new patrol take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in. He may be all right, but I'd rather have somebody
in the Black Eagles who isn't such a dub."</p>

<p>With only three more events on the program, the
Scouts' lead seemed to promise a sure victory. But
when the All-School team romped away with both
first and second places in the broad jump, matters
began to look more grave. Once more, Rodman Cree
made a mess of his efforts as a jumper. He switched
between taking off clumsily and falling back after
landing.</p>

<p>"He just won't do," said Roundy soberly, as the
city hall clock struck eleven.</p>

<p>"But he's really trying," protested Bunny. "His
laughing and all that is just on the surface. He likes
us, and he wants to make us like him."</p>

<p>"Too many other good fellows in school to bother
with him," Roundy retorted. He paused for a moment.
"Bunny, I wish I could stay for the relay race,
but I promised my father to mow the lawn this forenoon,
and I can't get it done unless I start now. You
don't need me as a sub, do you?"</p>

<p>Bunny shook his head. "No; we have S. S., Specs,
Jump and myself; and Nap could be shoved in at a
pinch. You trot along, and this afternoon we'll tell
you how we won. Anyhow, I think this pole vault
will give us a nice lead. That's one thing Nap can
do, to say nothing of Jump."</p>

<p>Had Nap been satisfied to limit his strength to pole-vaulting,
he might have made a first in that event; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>

he came to it exhausted from his earlier efforts, and his
best was a creditable third. Jump's knee, bruised
from the hurdles, was bumped again in his first attempt.
Second place was the limit for him.</p>

<p>The score was a tie, therefore, with the result of
the meet depending upon the relay race.</p>

<p>"We'll be ready to run in two minutes," Bunny
said, and turned to discover Jump limping toward him.
The boy's face was drawn with the effort he was making
to walk naturally.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm all right, Bunny. My knee will straighten
out in just a minute. Please let me run. I'll be all
right as soon as I start."</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs bent beside him, as Bunny examined
Jump's right knee, which was discolored from its
bruises and already slightly swollen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't do," said Horace Hibbs firmly. "It will
come around all right in a day or two, but he must
not abuse it by running in the relay. I won't have it.
You'll have to get somebody else."</p>

<p>Bunny nodded agreement. "Oh, Nap!"</p>

<p>From his blanket on the ground, the Scout pried
himself to his feet, with legs none too steady under
him.</p>

<p>"Can't use him, either," decreed the Scout Master.
"He has been running his head off in every event from
the half mile down, and he is thoroughly exhausted.
I won't allow him to start."</p>

<p>Bunny frowned. Though the man was right, it left
no choice when it came to picking the fourth runner in
the race. For a moment, he wished with all his heart
that Bi, or even Roundy, were there; but it was too late
now for wishing.</p>

<p>"Rodman," he called, "I'm putting you on our relay
team."</p>

<p>The boy's eyes opened wide. "I'll try, of course,
but you know as well as I do that I can't run to
amount to anything."</p>

<p>"All you have to do is your best. Nobody wants
any more of you than that. Three of us are better
than any three on their team. You will start the third
relay with a lead, sure, and if you lose it on your lap,
I'll try to gain it back the last time around."</p>

<p>With quick, eager movements, Rodman Cree
stripped off his jersey. "I am going to do all I can,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
he said in a low voice. "And you don't know how
much I want to help you win."</p>

<p>"Look here," whispered the excited Specs, as he
pulled Bunny to one side. "Do you mean that you
are going to trust him to run in this race?"</p>

<p>"There's nobody else."</p>

<p>"He'll lose the race for us."</p>

<p>"Not if we other three gain on our laps as we
should."</p>

<p>"He'll lose the race for us," repeated Specs despairingly,
"and then, when it's all over, he'll laugh.
I know him."</p>

<p>"Places for the relay!" shouted Horace Hibbs.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE RELAY RACE</p>

<p class="pn p2">"It wasn't much of an argument," Scout Master
Hibbs confessed to his relay team. "I simply suggested
that we have each runner pass the little block
to the next, rather than merely touch hands. Buck
Claxton was the only one to raise any objection. He
runs the last lap."</p>

<p>None of the four to whom he was speaking offered
any comment. It was Jump Henderson who finally
spoke; poor lame, disappointed Jump.</p>

<p>"Probably figured that if the race was close, he
could get away before the third runner touched him,"
he offered.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're wrong there." The speaker was Rodman
Cree. "I'm sure you're wrong. I know Buck.
He isn't that sort at all. He wouldn't even think of
taking an unfair advantage."</p>

<p>Bunny happened to be looking at Horace Hibbs,
who, in turn, was staring fixedly at the new boy. "I
suppose not," agreed the Scout Master, in a tone that
was not wholly reassuring. "Anyhow, the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
block makes trickery impossible; that's why it has been
adopted so widely. Well, let's get over to the track."</p>

<p>There was something queer, Bunny felt, in the man's
speech. It was as if he suspected somebody's honesty;
not Buck Claxton's, perhaps, but&mdash;well, somebody's.
He couldn't quite make it out.</p>

<p>But once Bunny was lined up beside the cinder track
back of the Black Eagles' clubhouse, he forgot everything
except the race itself. Everybody was cheering
and yelling advice and encouragement; horns were
tooting, and somebody who had brought a bell was
clanging it madly. It was no time for solving puzzles.</p>

<p>Almost before he realized it, the race began. The
crowd gasped suddenly and went absolutely still. A
shot rang out; and around the queer, slanting track ran
S. S., of the Scouts, and some tall, thin chap of the All-School
team, whom Buck had been saving for just this
event. Instead of the easy race S. S. had expected,
Bunny could see that he was fully extended to hold his
own. Side by side the two runners raced, neither able
to wrest a yard's advantage from the other. The
crowd seemed to have gone mad.</p>

<p>"Get ready, Specs," he heard Horace Hibbs say;
and good old Specs, who ran the second relay, walked,
trembling with excitement, to the starting line. Bunny
puzzled gravely over his teammate's display of emotion
and could not understand it, until he recalled that
his turn would come presently, and that he must take
up the race where Rodman Cree dropped it. His own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
cheeks reddened hotly, and his fists persisted in clenching
and unclenching spasmodically as he waited and
waited.</p>

<p>S. S. swept around the last sharp curve, with his
body leaning far inward, and held out his little crimson
block of wood. Still running by his side, the tall, thin
chap thrust forward a blue one. Two clutching hands
closed upon them, and Specs and his opponent were off
upon the second relay. The race was still nip and tuck,
with no advantage to either team.</p>

<p>But there was no holding Specs. He ran as if his
very life depended upon eluding the other fellow; and
little by little, just an inch or two in each few strides,
he forged into a clean lead. Rodman Cree was on the
track now, waiting his turn with white, set face and
wildly groping fingers. As Specs reached him at last,
now a good dozen yards ahead of the All-School fellow,
Bunny sucked in his breath. Suppose&mdash;suppose
something should happen; some accident, say, that
would mull things up and worry the new boy.</p>

<p>But none did. As smoothly as clockwork, Specs
reached forth a hand with the crimson block, and Rodman
grasped it and began to run. There has been no
pause, no halt, no delay whatever. And the third man
of the Scouts' relay was off with a commanding lead.</p>

<p>Bunny relaxed and began to breathe easier. By his
side, some boy was puffing mightily, like a motor with
its exhaust open. Not till the other spoke, though,
did Bunny recognize who it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"He&mdash;he can't hold his&mdash;lead," wheezed Specs
mournfully. "See! What&mdash;what did I tell you?
He's losing&mdash;losing ground every second."</p>

<p>Rodman was, too. There was no question about his
determination; he was running with every ounce of
will and ambition. But something was wrong.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's just no good!" puffed Specs. "Can't
run&mdash;or jump&mdash;or throw&mdash;or anything. No
good!"</p>

<p>The All-School runner was at Rodman's heels now.
He swerved to the outside and came abreast of his opponent.
For a brief span, they ran side by side.
Then, like an elastic band that stretches longer and
longer as the pull upon it increases, the gap widened
alarmingly.</p>

<p>"I told you so," groaned Specs. "He's going to
lose the race for us."</p>

<p>"It isn't lost yet," said Bunny grimly. He walked
out upon the track, breathing hard and with knees
wobbling treacherously. It seemed suffocatingly hot.
Already his forehead was moist with perspiration.</p>

<p>The seconds he waited for the runners to reach
him seemed to stretch into hours. At last, when the
suspense was driving twitches through every muscle
of his body, he heard the grateful <i>thud-thud</i> of feet
behind him. Half turning, he held out his hand. But
it was not Rodman; he realized that when he saw that
the extended block was blue. Buck Claxton grabbed
it, leaped forward like a race horse when the barrier is
sprung, and was yards away before Bunny's bewildered
brain righted.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Rodman Cree came pounding in at last. But just as
he reached a point a foot or two short of Bunny, he
tripped suddenly and fell, plunging toward his team
mate from the impetus of his running. The accident
was embarrassing, to be sure, but it could hardly have
occurred at a luckier spot. Even as he sprawled helplessly
toward Bunny, that runner took a quick side-step,
to prevent a violent collision, and dashed forward upon
the last relay of the race.</p>

<p>The pursuit of Buck seemed well-nigh hopeless. But
Bunny did not despair. He fixed his eyes on the
bobbing head of the boy in front of him, and urged
himself toward it with every muscle of his lithe legs
and every beat of his stout heart. On the straightaway
portions of the track, he bent forward till it seemed
he must fall; on the curves, he leaned inward till those
near him among the spectators moved rapidly away in
alarm. Always he kept his unwavering gaze upon the
stubby shock of black hair that flaunted before him;
and, little by little, it grew nearer and more distinct.</p>

<p>His wonderful burst of speed shook the crowd to a
mighty roar of applause. He did not hear it. He did
not even know they were cheering him. He was dumb
to everything but the <i>thud-thud</i> of Buck's foot-beats
and the beckoning thatch of his jerking head. His
only thought was the dogged determination to reach
and pass Buck. He must do it. He could do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Why, the race&mdash;the whole meet&mdash;depended upon his
beating Buck!</p>

<p>The time came when the shaggy head was before
his very face. He swung to the right, ever so slightly,
and parted his lips in a parched grin as he saw from
the corner of his eye that it was by his side. When he
risked another glance, he was in front of the bobbing
head. But even as he exulted, Buck drew upon some
hidden reserve of strength and pulled up even again.</p>

<p>They were at the very finish now, with the tape just
ahead. For one last desperate moment, Bunny forced
his legs to drive a tiny degree faster than they had
been pounding, lifted his hands high in the air, threw
himself forward, and felt the flimsy woolen string hit
his chest,&mdash;hit it, cling for one awful instant, and then
snap.</p>

<p>He had won. The relay, with its eight points for
the winner, was safely tucked in the Scouts' total of
firsts and seconds. Race and meet were theirs.</p>

<p>The cheering boys who had watched the heart-breaking
finish charged upon him. He was lifted high
upon the shoulders of Roundy and Jump, now quite
unaware of their own lame and halt condition. S. S.
and Specs were pounded and buffeted about. Of the
four runners of the victorious team, only Rodman Cree
was neglected.</p>

<p>Afterward, in the clubhouse, where the remaining
six members of the Scout team retreated to get away
from the boisterous crowd, there was more jubilation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Everybody seemed to want to talk at once; that is,
everybody except Rodman Cree, who sat a little back
from the group and stared straight ahead, not smiling
or laughing now. So great was the babel that it took
Horace Hibbs a minute or two to make himself heard,
when he came in abruptly.</p>

<p>"There's an argument outside," he began abruptly.
"A&mdash;yes, you might call it a protest. They claim
you fellows didn't win the race fairly."</p>

<p>"Who says so?" It was Spec's indignant voice.
"Buck Claxton?"</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs' solemn face relaxed into the hint of a
smile. "No, not Buck. Somebody else; somebody
not on the All-School team; somebody who doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Rodman. It was just as if he had
said, "I'm glad it wasn't Buck."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;why&mdash;What do they mean, we didn't
win fairly?" stuttered Specs.</p>

<p>"The claim has been made," Horace Hibbs told
them, speaking very slowly, "that your third runner
did not pass the block of wood to Bunny, who ran the
last relay. If it was not properly passed, and Bunny
ran without it, he may be disqualified."</p>

<p>The resultant silence was vaguely disquieting.
Outside, a wondering breeze whipped through the oak
tree at the back of the clubhouse, and a dozen dried
leaves pattered on the roof like raindrops.</p>

<p>"Well?" Horace Hibbs straightened his shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
as if he had a disagreeable task to perform. "Suppose
we thresh out the claim. What are the facts,
Bunny?"</p>

<p>But before the Scout leader could answer, Rodman
Cree pushed his way into the little circle. "I can tell
you," he said unsmilingly. "Just before I reached
Bunny, you remember, I tripped and fell. I dropped
the block on the track instead of passing it to him."</p>

<p>A bomb could not have produced greater sensation.
Specs uttered an exclamation of disgust. S. S., hero
of the first relay, gasped audibly. Bunny nodded
grudgingly. Only Horace Hibbs seemed to take it in
other than in a spirit of disaster.</p>

<p>"I am glad there is no dispute about the facts in
here," he said. Bunny glanced up quickly and found
the man's face beaming happily once more. "Yes, I
am more than glad," continued Horace Hibbs. "Because,
you see, I have already taken up the matter with
Buck Claxton."</p>

<p>"And he thinks his team won?" snapped Specs.</p>

<p>"No," said Rodman Cree quickly. "He doesn't,
does he, Mr. Hibbs?"</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs fairly exuded good-nature. Something
seemed to have pleased him immensely.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted; "Buck said&mdash;let me see if I
can quote him exactly&mdash;he said, 'Shucks, no, Hibbs!
We don't want to claim we weren't licked fair and
square, when we were. We lost because Bunny Payton
ran the eye-teeth out of me on that last lap. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
block doesn't count. That was why I objected to it
in the first place: 'fraid somebody would lose it and
gum up things. You go and tell your bunch of Boy
Scouts that they beat us to-day for the first and
last time&mdash;yep, beat us on the level; but that I can
get up a gang that will wipe the earth with them at
football or baseball or basketball or anything else&mdash;except
a track meet.' And so"&mdash;Horace Hibbs
smiled broadly&mdash;"so you may consider yourselves
told, and act accordingly. But I should suggest that
hereafter you and Buck work together for the good of
the school, instead of against each other."</p>

<p>"We will," promised Bunny; and he was heartily
seconded by little echoing tags of, "Sure, we will!"
and "You bet!" and "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Horace Hibbs. "I don't see
how any track meet could prove a greater success." He
walked to the door and turned for a final word.
"Nap, I am inclined to think Napoleon was right when
he said, 'There are no Alps.'"</p>

<p>Bunny didn't pretend to understand this queer remark.
But he would have been a very laggard Boy
Scout, indeed, if he had failed to observe one thing.
Although Horace Hibbs spoke to Nap, he was looking
straight at Rodman Cree.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">SCHOOL ELECTIONS</p>

<p class="pn p2">"Just a minute, fellows!" called Bunny, as the other
Scouts straggled toward the door of the clubhouse,
after Horace Hibbs had gone. "I want to tell you
something. This morning I spoke to Professor Leland
about having a meeting of the whole school, to
get ourselves organized and to elect officers. The
school, you see, is a good deal like a troop of Boy
Scouts; there must be a leader over everybody, and each
branch, like each patrol, must have its leader, too. I
mean that a student president is to be elected, and a
football manager, and somebody to head the athletic association,
and&mdash;and I don't know what else."</p>

<p>"When will the meeting be?" asked Nap.</p>

<p>"Professor Leland says it will be held late this afternoon,
just before our first football practice. Now, the
school may feel like electing some of us to offices&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Specs complacently. "Will
there be enough offices for all of us, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to talk about," the
patrol leader answered soberly. "We're organized, of
course, and we're known by most of the students, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
I think we're pretty well liked. If two or three of us
are elected, that will be fine. But we mustn't use
our&mdash;our power to run things. We mustn't try for
all the offices. There are lots of other bully fellows
in school, and we want the best man elected to each
office, whether he's a Black Eagle or not."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Specs gloomily. "That won't be the
way Buck Claxton and his gang will look at it.
They'll be out to gobble everything they can get. I'll
bet they have it all figured out already."</p>

<p>But at a quarter of four that afternoon, when Professor
Leland announced to the school that the remaining
fifteen minutes of the period would be devoted
to a mass meeting of all the pupils, it was evident
that "Buck and his gang" had heard nothing of
the plan. As a matter of fact, Buck looked uneasily
at Peter Barrett, the farmer boy, and at Royal Sheffield,
who came to school in an eight-cylinder motor
car, as if he were wondering whether they were at the
bottom of this move. Marion Genevieve Chester and
Clarence Prissier also appeared at a loss. Rodman
Cree, who seemed to have forgotten how to smile,
showed neither surprise nor any other emotion.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," Professor Leland began, "we
have our first football practice. It is customary, of
course, for the squad to elect its own captain, but the
school should vote on the team's manager. Moreover,
we shall need somebody to act permanently as president
of the athletic association, whose duty it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to look after all athletic activities. One boy has spoken
to me about a literary and debating society. Now
would be an excellent time for its organization. And,
lastly, although it will be better to have a temporary
chairman of this meeting, we need a president of the
student body to handle future elections. Nominations
are now in order for temporary chairman."</p>

<p>"I am going to nominate you, Bunny," Nap whispered
excitedly from across the aisle.</p>

<p>Bunny shook his head. "Please don't. They will
think we are trying to run the school."</p>

<p>"I nominate Peter Barrett," flashed Buck.</p>

<p>This was too much for Specs. "I nominate Bi&mdash;I
mean, Charlie Jones," he countered.</p>

<p>"Move that the nominations be closed." It was
Buck again.</p>

<p>"All those in favor of Mr. Barrett say 'Aye,'" announced
Professor Leland, when it had been decided
to accept no more names.</p>

<p>The room shook with the thunder of the answer.</p>

<p>"All those in favor of Mr. Jones will signify in the
same manner."</p>

<p>The response was hearty, but hardly a third as loud
as the first.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barrett has been elected temporary chairman
of this meeting," decided Professor Leland. "He will
take the chair at once."</p>

<p>Amid a good deal of hand-clapping, Peter Barrett
climbed to the rostrum and pounded on the principal's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
desk with a ruler. His face was red and his patched
clothes very conspicuous, but he spoke calmly and
slowly.</p>

<p>"Nominations for manager of the football team,"
he invited.</p>

<p>A little movement a few seats away caught Bunny's
eye. After writing something on a slip of paper,
Royal Sheffield passed it down the aisle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman."</p>

<p>"Mr. Claxton."</p>

<p>"I nominate Roy Sheffield." Quite as if it had
been arranged beforehand, the mention of the name
was greeted with a volley of applause.</p>

<p>Bunny moved uneasily in his seat before rising to be
recognized. In some inexplicable manner, he sensed
that some plot he could not fathom was under way,
and that it was a move against the Black Eagle Patrol.
Perhaps he could swing the school with a neat speech
of nomination.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, I want to propose the name of a
boy who has the ability to handle this job as well as
anybody in school. In the first place, he has brains;
in the second place, he can give his whole attention to
his job, as I think he is too light to play on the team;
in the third place, he has had plenty of experience, because
he's managed a scrub team that we Boy Scouts
have had for the last two years. He arranged games
for us, and he fixed the business end so well that at the
end of last season we had our football suits paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and a little left over. And you'll admit that's pretty
good for a team of kids. I don't suppose it's necessary
to say for him, any more than it is for anybody else in
this school, that he's absolutely honest. I nominate
Emerson Elliot Meeker."</p>

<p>"For the love of Marengo!" gasped Nap Meeker,
who had grown very red.</p>

<p>A boy named Leeton was nominated by a little clique
at the back of the room. After a long pause, during
which nobody seemed to have anything to offer, the
nominations were closed.</p>

<p>"Count the ballots," ordered Peter Barrett to the
volunteer ushers who had collected the slips of paper
from the pupils. It took nearly five minutes to total
the various choices.</p>

<p>"The vote for manager," announced the chairman,
"has resulted as follows: Meeker, 10; Leeton, 17;
Sheffield, 80. Mr. Sheffield has been elected manager
of the football team."</p>

<p>Puzzled and hurt, Bunny Payton crushed in his
hand the note that Specs had just slipped over his right
shoulder. What was the matter? Why had Nap been
so badly beaten? Why? Opening his hand, he
smoothed out the note and read in Specs' angular handwriting:</p>

<p class="pq1 p1">Bunny:</p>

<p class="pq1">You will have to admit that we are not the only
wideawake bunch in school. I have just seen Molly
Sefton, and she says that all yesterday afternoon Buck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and his gang were going around telling everybody that
we Scouts had said we were going to boss this school.
I don't know who is at the bottom of it; maybe <i>Rodman
the Athlete</i>. (Specs had underlined these three
words.) Anyhow, there are a lot of people just waiting
for a chance to vote against a Boy Scout, whether
he is any good or not.</p>

<p class="p75">&mdash;Specs.</p>

<p class="p1">Bunny set his teeth. He hoped Specs was mistaken.
But if it should turn out to be true&mdash;</p>

<p>Professor Leland had left the room when Peter Barrett,
rapping smartly on the desk, called for the election
of a president of the athletic association.</p>

<p>A fellow named Bob Kiproy nominated Buck Claxton.</p>

<p>Specs hopped to his feet, plainly excited. "I nominate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Move the nominations be closed," interrupted
Sheffield.</p>

<p>While Specs struggled against the current, wildly
protesting, the motion was carried with a roar, and a
moment later Buck Claxton was declared unanimously
elected president of the athletic association.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Specs did his best to nominate S.
S. for the presidency of the literary society, but again
the school overwhelmed him, carrying into office Clarence
Prissier on the crest of the tidal wave.</p>

<p>But one more place remained to be filled. However
much the opposition had made up its mind to bar all
Scouts from office, it was clear that Specs had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
desperate. Before the chairman had finished asking
for somebody to head the student association, Specs
was on his feet, waving his right arm and shouting
wildly, "Mr. Chairman!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cree."</p>

<p>Peter Barrett was looking directly over Specs' head
toward Rodman Cree, who stood, feet apart, in the
aisle. The Scout construed this recognition as another
unjust fling at the patrol, although, as a matter of fact,
Rodman had risen an instant before Specs.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman!" the latter repeated.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cree has the floor," declared Peter Barrett.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I nominate&mdash;" Specs began lamely.</p>

<p>The chairman rapped again on his desk. "We are
hearing from Mr. Cree. Go on, Mr. Cree."</p>

<p>Now, Bunny, for one, was in no sense adverse to
hearing Rodman's nomination. He liked the new boy,
and he was sure the new boy liked him, to say nothing
of the others in the Black Eagle Patrol. Although he
might have scoffed openly at the idea, deep in his heart
he was confident that Rodman was about to show his
true colors and nominate one of the Scouts; not just
any one of them, but their leader, Bunny himself.</p>

<p>As Specs floundered back to his seat, Rodman Cree
began. "I don't want to nominate any fellow for this
office," he said. "I just want to make a suggestion.
It's this: There are about forty boys in this school and
over sixty girls; and I think this last office should go to
a girl." He sat down to a gathering applause that began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with a few faint hand-spats and ended in a tumult
of cheering. The speech was like a douche of cold
water to Bunny.</p>

<p>"I nominate Marion Genevieve Chester!" shouted
Buck through the noise.</p>

<p>Immediately, as before, the nominations were closed,
and Marion declared elected. Then, just as the minute
hand of the clock touched four, Peter Barrett declared
the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">NOBODY</p>

<p class="pi1 p2">"Who cheers me up when I feel sad?<br />
Nobody!"<br />
</p>

<p class="pn p1">sang S. S. softly, as the pupils trooped down the stairs
from the assembly room and out the main door.</p>

<p class="pi1 p1">
"Who gets me out when I'm in bad?<br />
Nobody!"<br />
</p>

<p class="pn p1">It was Roundy who carried on the refrain. "That
song is pretty near right; don't you think so, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"I've stopped thinking," said Bunny shortly.
"It's about time to do something."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"That's for us to find out."</p>

<p>Some twenty of the Lakeville High boys were reporting
for football practice. Those with suits shifted
to the basement, where a shower bath and lockers had
been installed, while the others tramped directly to the
field back of the schoolhouse, to begin their work with
punting and drop-kicking.</p>

<p>The little basement was crowded with candidates in
various stages of undress. But because their two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of experience had accustomed them to slipping into
their togs in a hurry, the seven Scouts were the first to
leave. By common consent, they moved to the shady
plot under the big oak.</p>

<p>"Something has happened," Bunny said briefly.
"For some reason, the whole school is against us. I
don't know why; but whatever the reason is, we'll
have to prove that we're the right sort, and that we're
not trying to run the school or anybody else except
ourselves. The question is, how to do it."</p>

<p>"I know how I'd do it," said Specs. "I'd pull right
out of this business, unless they want to treat us right.
We've played scrub football for two years and made
four trips; and I don't believe there is anybody else
in school who has been on a regular eleven. Just say
the word, Bunny, and we'll get up a team of our own."</p>

<p>Roundy growled assent.</p>

<p>"No, we don't want to do that." Bunny doubled
his fists emphatically. "You remember what Horace
Hibbs said about working for the school. Fighting
the school isn't the kind of thing Scouts ought to do.
We don't even care who runs it; all we want is a fair
chance to help."</p>

<p>"We won't get it. From now on, Bunny, any time
we try something, it will be Waterloo for us," Nap
jerked an indignant nod.</p>

<p>"Why can't we take one of them into the patrol for
our eighth member?" put in Bi. "Suppose Buck, for
instance&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunny shook his head. "A week or two ago, Buck
might have joined the Black Eagles, but now, if we
asked him after this election, he'd think we wanted
him because we couldn't get along without him and
because we could run the school through him. And I
guess that goes for the rest of them, too."</p>

<p>"I know they wouldn't be Scouts," added S. S.
"I heard Buck and Roy Sheffield and Bob Kiproy talking
together. What they are trying to do is to get up
a secret society to buck our patrol."</p>

<p>"Then there is just one thing for us," Bunny said
earnestly, "and that is to go on being the right kind of
Scouts just as hard as we can. If we take care of our
good turns, they'll take care of us. And if we are
loyal and helpful and trustworthy, and live up to the
rest of the Scout law, they're going to take off their
hats to us, whether they think so now or not. What's
more, I bet that before the end of the year they will be
asking us how they can form a patrol of their own."</p>

<p>"That's all right!" Specs interrupted suddenly.
"Maybe they will&mdash;at the end of the year. But right
now four or five of us are going to make the football
team. You know more about the game and can play
better than anybody else in school. Are they going to
elect you captain or aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Can't find out till the votes are counted," Bunny
returned cheerily. "If anybody nominates me for captain,
I'll run, of course."</p>

<p>"Then you'll run, all right," promised Specs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
"And if you are not elected, then I'm through with
football at this school. Ab-so-lute-ly! I'll take my
suit home to-night. Come on; there's Professor Leland
waving to us."</p>

<p>Gathering the squad about him, the principal explained
that the school board had detailed him as coach.
"We may as well begin our practice," he said, "by lining
up on both sides of the playground and punting the
ball back and forth."</p>

<p>First kick at the oval fell to Buck Claxton. Perhaps
he was a bit nervous. At any rate, his toe, instead
of whirling the ball roof high, sent it tumbling
and bounding along the ground, till a low bounce shot it
into Bunny's arms.</p>

<p>"Now show 'em what you can do!" urged Specs in
a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Carefully poising the ball, Bunny booted it up and
across the field, till it spun down with a plop into Bi's
arms.</p>

<p>"Nice work, Payton!" shouted the coach.</p>

<p>"That's showing him!" commented Specs. "He'll
see that you didn't play in the back-field two years for
nothing. Why, there isn't anybody else in the squad
who can punt like that."</p>

<p>The next ten minutes proved Specs' boast. Not
only could Bunny punt far and away better than the
other candidates, but he could drop-kick almost as well.
And when the players formed in a great circle and fell
upon the ball, the members of the Black Eagle Patrol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
distinguished themselves again. With the exception
of Roundy, who dove so heavily that the ball escaped
through his arms, the Scouts downed the pigskin as
surely as though it were a watermelon. With the
others, this practice did not go as well; even Buck
Claxton missed as the ball bounded at an unexpected
angle.</p>

<p>"We'll top off with a little running and tackling,"
announced the coach, as he retrieved the ball from the
last man. "Jones, you take your place forty yards
down the field, to catch punts and run them back. Kiproy,
you go with him to act as interference. And Claxton,
when the ball is punted, you charge down the field
and try to tackle Jones between the knees and waist."</p>

<p>With Bi in position, Kiproy beside him, and Buck
crouching on the line, the coach kicked. It was a high
punt, and Buck was almost upon the pair before the
ball plumped into Bi's arms. Kiproy ran toward the
tackier, but Buck, swerving to one side, eluded him and
drove squarely at Bi's legs. Had the latter been under
full speed, he would have toppled like a falling tree;
instead, checking himself, he jolted back out of the
grasping arms, and while Buck floundered in the dust,
jogged complacently down the field.</p>

<p>"All right, Payton; you act as tackler this time.
Claxton catches the ball. Jones is the interference."</p>

<p>Specs slapped Bunny on the back. "Show 'em what
you can do. Grab that fellow, if it takes a leg!"</p>

<p>Either Bunny was luckier than Buck, or a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
tackler; opinion stood divided. But whatever the truth
of the matter, Bunny skillfully dodged Bi's forward defense
(and Bi was playing hard, too) and managed to
stop Buck and actually throw the heavier boy backward.</p>

<p>With the next shift, Bunny caught the punt. Buck,
with his lack of experience, bungled the interference,
but Bunny pushed off Sheffield with his open palm, and
romped safely out of danger. Later, on the last change,
Bunny shouldered hard-running Peter Barrett out of
the way as interference, thereby giving safe passage to
Roundy, even after the latter had fumbled the ball.</p>

<p>"You are running away with the game, Payton,"
smiled the coach kindly. "If you keep this up, we
shall have to put you in a team by yourself."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you!" chuckled Specs. "No matter
whether they like the Scouts or not, they have to
elect you captain. There just isn't anybody else."</p>

<p>Bunny said nothing. However much of a glow he
felt over Professor Leland's compliment, there remained
the undeniable fact that the school was at outs
with the Black Eagle Patrol. It was unpleasant to be
in this position, but it was worse still to realize how this
attitude hampered the Scouts at every turn, both in
working for the good of the school and in creating interest
in the Scout movement.</p>

<p>Specs insisted, in a very audible whisper, that Rodman
Cree was part and parcel of this conspiracy, and
even hinted that he had purposely tried to lose the relay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
race, both while it was being run and afterward, and
had later prevented a fitting nomination for presidency
of the student association.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" he growled, as Rodman failed in an
easy tackle. "He's no good at anything in the world;
anybody can see that. But he makes himself solid with
the other crowd by hitting at us."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, could they have known it, Royal Sheffield
was saying much the same thing about poor Rodman,
except that it was Sheffield's idea that the new
boy was trying to "get in" with the Scouts by working
against the balance of the school.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" commented the coach, as the last
uniformed player went down the field for a tackle.
"We have the material for a strong team. Now I
want you to elect a good man captain, and we shall
call it a day's work."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence in the crowd gathered
about Professor Leland, which was broken by Specs,
his voice high-pitched and shrill.</p>

<p>"I nominate the best player in the squad&mdash;Bunny
Payton!"</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Sheffield nominated Buck Claxton;
and Jack Turner, whose farm adjoined the Barrett
place, put forward Peter.</p>

<p>"If anybody has the nerve to vote for Buck after
the showing he has made this afternoon," said Specs
hoarsely, "I'll eat my hat."</p>

<p>The coach himself collected the bits of paper which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
had been distributed as ballots, and counted the returns.</p>

<p>"The vote stands as follows," he said slowly.
"Barrett has received two, Payton seven, and Claxton
eleven. Claxton is therefore elected captain of the
team. The practice to-morrow night will be at the
same time. All those who have no suits will see me before
they go home."</p>

<p>The Scouts stood dumbfounded. Bunny was the
first to recover, leaving the group and walking over to
congratulate Buck with a warm handshake.</p>

<p>"Well," observed Specs, "what about it? Do we
quit this rotten business, or don't we?"</p>

<p>"No," Bunny snapped, "we don't. We keep right
on practicing every night. If they won't put us on the
first eleven, we'll play on the second."</p>

<p>"You can play on the third, if you feel like it."
Specs had completely lost his temper. "As for me,
I've eaten all the crow that's good for me. I'm
through!" He turned his back and walked rapidly
toward the basement.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Bunny stood fast on the field,
while the others of the squad drifted toward the dressing
room. Rodman Cree he could see waiting uneasily
at one side, as if he wished to come up and speak to him.
But though Bunny had none of Specs' feeling toward
Rodman, at that particular moment he did not wish to
speak to anybody. He stared toward the road, pretending
to be unconscious of the other's presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>From the basement floated the tenor voice of S. S.,
singing the final refrain of the "Nobody" song:</p>

<p class="pi1 p1">
"Who cares for us an awful lot?<br />
Who always helps us on the dot?<br />
Who is the only friend we've got?"<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">And the final word, roared by all of the six Scouts,
came out in a thundering:</p>

<p class="p1">"NOBODY!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">BEFORE THE WIND</p>

<p class="pn p2">Molly Sefton had something on her mind, a very
serious "something," Molly thought; and it was because
of this something that Rodman Cree had been
invited for his first canoe ride.</p>

<p>A light wind curled the water into tiny ripples. It
was morning of the last Saturday in September, and
across the lake you could see a faint yellowish-red
tinge on the maple trees of Shadow Island.</p>

<p>The two stood on the pier at the foot of High Street,
with the Seftons' new sailing canoe riding in the water
alongside. Only the day before it had been delivered
from the Fair Play Factory, and now, with the newly
varnished paddles and nickled trimmings and white
lateen sail, the craft looked very inviting indeed.</p>

<p>Molly giggled.</p>

<p>"What's funny?" Rodman turned, mildly surprised.</p>

<p>"You are! Why, I haven't seen you smile for a
week, but now you simply must, else I shan't allow you
in the canoe with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>He did smile, half-heartedly at first, and then more
broadly and honestly, till the smile had grown into an
old-time laugh.</p>

<p>"That's better. I am going to take you sailing, after
all. But are you sure," she added slyly, "that you
can swim?"</p>

<p>Rodman answered the question with a contemptuous
sniff. "Maybe you can't, though," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I just can," Molly asserted proudly; "I can
swim two hundred yards. If I kick off my slippers,
this dress won't be much heavier than a bathing suit,
either. But, of course, father says I must do my sailing
where it isn't deep."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better edge the shore to that bay by
Magoon's boathouse; there's lots of room for tacking,
and it's all shallow water."</p>

<p>Molly stared suspiciously at the stretch of lake he
had pointed out. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Look at the color of the water. Don't you notice
that it is a whole lot lighter than the rest of the lake?
And did you ever see anybody fishing there? And did
you ever notice how that steamer from the other end
of the lake never puts in, even when it wants to land
somebody at Magoon's pier?"</p>

<p>Molly nodded slowly. "But if it's so shallow, why
isn't it a swimming-hole?"</p>

<p>For a moment, Rodman had no answer. "I don't
know&mdash;Yes, I do, too. Look at the beach. If you've
ever walked along it, you know there's the finest collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of sharp stones on that beach you ever saw, and
it must be the same way under water. You couldn't
go in swimming there unless you wore hobnailed shoes."</p>

<p>"You're right," Molly admitted, "though I never put
things together like that. Of course, then, that's the
place for us to go."</p>

<p>While Rodman steadied the canoe, she climbed in
gingerly, holding to the pier with one hand until he was
also aboard.</p>

<p>"Wait just a minute before you push off," she
warned. "Somebody's coming."</p>

<p>"It's Horace Hibbs," he said, continuing to look
toward the bow of the boat and away from the pier.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Molly's voice showed her
surprise.</p>

<p>"By his step, of course. Hello, Mr. Hibbs!"</p>

<p>Smiling and genial, the Scout Master bustled out to
the end of the pier.</p>

<p>"Caught a glimpse of you down here; so I thought I
would stroll over and see you set sail. Better stick to
that bay over there by Magoon's, Molly. It is a nice,
level beach, not higher than your chin anywhere.
Ready for the football game this afternoon, Rodman?"</p>

<p>"I am as ready as I'll ever be, sir," the boy returned
slowly.</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs laughed. "We can't all make the
team. You will have your chance some day. All
ready, Molly? Lee-board set? I'll give you an easy
start, and in a second or two you will be under way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>In no time at all, it seemed to Rodman, the sail had
filled, and the canoe was slipping over the surface as
gracefully and with as little effort as a swan floating
downstream.</p>

<p>"All you have to do," Molly told him, "is to sit still
and let me manage the boat. I am a very good sailor."</p>

<p>For the second time that morning, Rodman laughed.
"You may be a very good sailor, but you're not a very
old sailor."</p>

<p>Molly paid out the sheet a bit. "I don't see how
you know whether I am an old sailor or just a beginner.
Maybe I have been sailing canoes for years."</p>

<p>"I don't know for sure," apologized Rodman, "but
not longer than a week ago I saw you in the library
getting a book on sailing. Now, I never heard of a real
sailor reading a book about it. They always know it
all; at least, they always say they do."</p>

<p>It was Molly's turn to laugh now. "You're right.
I haven't been at it for years; but Horace Hibbs took
me out nine or ten times in that canoe of his, and the
last few times I sailed it all by myself. Then yesterday,
too, I took him out in mine, and he never gave
me a bit of advice, and I tacked and came about and
made a beautiful landing&mdash;he said so himself. But
you do notice things, don't you, Rodman? I've never
seen anybody that noticed little things the way you do."</p>

<p>They were in the bay now, and Molly pointed the
canoe toward the outer edge of the shallow area. The
wind was almost directly inshore, but by keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
sheet close-hauled Molly skimmed along at a merry clip
almost into the teeth of the breeze.</p>

<p>"Ready to come about," warned Molly.</p>

<p>"Turn to your right; starboard, you know."</p>

<p>Easily and with a fair degree of safety, the canoe
came about to port. Rodman shook his head.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't risk that, Molly. When you turn
again, running before the wind, come about the simple
and natural way&mdash;toward the lower tip of your sail."</p>

<p>She stole a quick look at him. "How do you know
which is better? You told me you were never in a sail-boat
before."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't been. Shucks, that's just common
sense. If you come about the right way, the sail only
straightens out; if you swing the wrong way, the&mdash;the
boom, I guess you call it, whips across the boat and
may upset it. Anyhow, I should think there would be
danger. But here is some first-class information. By
the looks of the lake, we are going to be in a dead calm
before two minutes; and after that"&mdash;he studied the
horizon&mdash;"look out!"</p>

<p>True to prediction, the breeze spent itself, leaving the
canoe tossing lightly some two hundred yards from
shore. Only a bank of hard-edged clouds proved that
the wind had not gone home for the day, but was merely
resting to muster reinforcements.</p>

<p>"I'm glad it died down," Molly said promptly, "because
now I can talk to you. Rodman Cree, I didn't
get you out here just to go sailing, but to find out what's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
wrong with you. For three weeks, at least, you've
been sneaking around like a hermit or something. You
don't go with anybody, and nobody goes with you.
You used to be happy and light-hearted; now I don't
even hear your whistle any more. You don't seem to
like anybody, and nobody seems to like you. What's
the matter, Rodman? Tell me about it."</p>

<p>He straightened his shoulders defiantly. "Well, I
guess there is no reason why the fellows should like
me. I'm no good. I'm no good at athletics; I can't
even play football. The Scouts think I am in with
Buck Claxton's gang, and Buck thinks I am working
for the Scouts. Why, Bunny Payton is the only friend
I have, and you know as well as I do that he has
troubles of his own right now."</p>

<p>Molly's eyes flashed. "It's miserable, that's what it
is; miserable that the school is all split up. But that's
no reason why you shouldn't have friends. Why don't
the Scouts like you?"</p>

<p>Chin on his hands, Rodman doggedly told her the
story of the field day between the Scouts and All-School
teams. "The Black Eagle fellows think I didn't run
my best in the relay race; they think, too, that I was
willing to toss away the win after it was over. But
that isn't the worst. Do you remember, at the school
election, when I said I thought a girl should have some
office. Well, the Scouts believe I said that just to keep
Specs McGrew from nominating Bunny for president
of the student association."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell them that wasn't so," Molly offered.</p>

<p>"It won't do any good. Bunny knows the truth, but
the others think I am just plain worthless. In football
it is the same. I have been out for practice since the
first day, but I haven't any chance of making the team.
And I am heavier and stronger than a lot of the players
on it, too. I've about decided to quit trying. Perhaps
my folks will move somewhere else next year. I
hope they do."</p>

<p>"But it is just a question of time," urged Molly,
"before you learn enough to play on the first eleven.
Surely you'll do it next year."</p>

<p>Rodman's shoulders settled back in a curve. "No, I
don't think I'll ever make it. I'm no good, that's all;
no good at anything."</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you, Rodman Cree!" Molly took
the sheet line in her fingers once more. "Yes, sir, just
plain ashamed of you for being a quitter! Why, if
the wind wasn't coming up, I believe I'd make you
walk ashore. So there!"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't make me feel any worse than I do
now."</p>

<p>Scudding across the lake, ruffling the placid water
into combing waves, a gust of wind was leaping toward
them. Molly surveyed it with approval. Her chin
was set in a firm little curve, and she nodded her head,
quite as if she had suddenly come to a decision.</p>

<p>"Watch!" she said.</p>

<p>As the first breath of the breeze reached them, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
let out the sheet. In less than a minute, as it tautened,
the canoe was racing before the romping wind, its
lateen sail almost at right angles to the craft.</p>

<p>In the exhilaration of the speed, Rodman forgot
his troubles. "Be ready to turn&mdash;come about, I
mean," he warned, "or you'll go ashore."</p>

<p>"I know what I am going to do," answered Molly, a
peculiar note in her voice. "You sit tight and wait."</p>

<p>Straight as an arrow, the bow cut the water, with
the growing wind tugging hard at the filled sail, till the
canoe seemed pulled ahead by some great but invisible
water animal.</p>

<p>"Ready!" shouted Rodman. "Sail's on the port
side, you know; don't come about to port."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to."</p>

<p>"You'll upset!"</p>

<p>"I won't upset! I know I can come up into the wind
by swinging to starboard, but I'm going to show you
that I can do it the other way, too."</p>

<p>"Molly!"</p>

<p>"You're just a passenger. You sit still and watch."
They were barely twenty-five yards from the shore.</p>

<p>"Coming about!" shouted Molly.</p>

<p>Instead of turning to starboard, she deliberately
forced the canoe to port. There was a moment of
suspense. Then, exultingly, the quickening wind lost
its grip on the sail, shivered it an instant as it hit the
edge, and finally banged it violently across the canoe.</p>

<p>"Keep your feet free of the lines!" Rodman yelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
as he threw his weight toward the windward side, in
an attempt to counterbalance its power.</p>

<p>"Look out for yourself!" Molly flung back. "I'm
going&mdash;"</p>

<p>She never finished her sentence. It was choked
short as the canoe heeled abruptly and dumped its occupants
into four feet of cool September lake.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood facing each other; Molly
laughing, Rodman furiously out of temper.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why don't you do what you can do?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" Molly retorted.</p>

<p>There was something in her voice that took the anger
out of his system.</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Molly pointed to a swimmer far over to the left.
"Who's that?"</p>

<p>Rodman shaded his eyes. "It's Specs. What's
that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"How do you know it's Specs?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure it is a <i>Scout</i>, because that's
where the Scouts go in swimming. Specs has quit
trying for the football team; so he's the only one that
would be in swimming, on account of the game this
afternoon. And I know the way Specs swims. He
uses the overhand stroke, and he does it a good deal
better with his right arm than his left."</p>

<p>"There you are!" Molly was triumphant. "Why
don't you take your own advice, and do what you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
do? You are a wonderful observer. You notice
everything, and you remember it, too. You can do
as much that way as any other. You were right when
you said that a girl should be elected to one of the
offices, and they all know you were right, no matter
what they say. You noticed something there, and you
had the courage to tell everybody else about it. What
if you can't make the team? If you just do your best,
the time is going to come when you will accomplish as
much by seeing as the rest will by doing."</p>

<p>The look on Rodman's face was a queer mixture of
shame and pleasure. He swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"You're right, Molly. You&mdash;you tipped us over
here on purpose, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Molly smiled, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're right," admitted Rodman Cree.
"And I'll&mdash;well, I'll prove that you are." He
swallowed again. "Now, if you say so, we'll walk this
boat to shore and get another start."</p>

<p>For the third time that morning, he smiled. As he
towed the light canoe ashore, he even whistled.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">TWO YARDS TO GO</p>

<p class="pn p2">"Hold 'em, Lakeville!"</p>

<p>The crowd surged against the rope that had been
stretched along the sides of the football field where the
Lakeville and the Grant City high-school teams were
playing the first game of the season. It was a vacant
lot at the north of town; not an ideal ground, by any
means, but put in order for the sport by being cleared
of rocks and stubble and marked with broad stripes of
whitewash.</p>

<p>"All ready, Chick!" "Are you ready, Bert?"
"Signal!" "What's the signal?" "Steady there."
"Signal?"</p>

<p>The Grant City team, which seemed to have occasional
spells of confused conversation, appeared all at
sea as the ball was about to be put in play.</p>

<p>"Signal?" "Hey, signal!"</p>

<p>The left guard and tackle of the visitors rose from
their crouch, apparently uncertain as to the play. At
that instant, however, the ball was passed. Logically,
with two men out of the play, Lakeville should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
had no trouble in stopping the runner with the ball.
But he crashed through the Lakeville line between right
tackle and end, past Peter Barrett, on secondary defense,
in spite of that youth's frantic dive, and so free
till, some twenty-five yards distant, Bunny, who was
playing back, wriggled through the interference and
plumped the runner to earth.</p>

<p>On the side lines, Substitute Rodman Cree dug his
finger nails into his palms. "It's a trick play," he
muttered. "They don't seem to understand it themselves,
but they gain every time they try it. What's
the secret?"</p>

<p>"Three minutes of the half left!" Horace Hibbs,
acting as official timer, squinted inquiringly at the two
teams. "If our boys don't stop that maneuver, Grant
is going to score, sure as shooting."</p>

<p>"It's the third time, too," Rodman put in, "but
they always gain their distance&mdash;and more. I wish
I could figure it out."</p>

<p>Following his resolution of the morning, he had
come to the game without hope of playing, but with
the fixed intent to do everything in his power for the
team. So far, he felt he had failed.</p>

<p>True, before the game started, his quick eye had
noted that the cord used by the linesmen for measuring
downs was almost a yard short. This fact he had
pointed out to Mr. Sefton, acting linesman for Lakeville,
and the mistake had been corrected. It was Rodman,
too, who before the game had discovered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
levered away a small boulder, hidden near one of the
goal posts. In the case of Bennett, the substitute halfback,
who squatted on the side lines and followed each
play with the movements of his body, thus wearing himself
out before he was put in the game, Rodman had
induced the boy, by a joking remark or two, to stretch
out and relax until he was wanted. But he felt that
these aids were really nothing at all. Wasn't it impossible,
after all, to do anything worth while for the
team when you weren't the coach, and couldn't play,
and when everybody had lost faith in you?</p>

<p>But, at least for the moment, he forgot his difficult
task in the smash of the play that was bringing the first
half to an end. The ball had touched Lakeville's
thirty-yard line, when Jump intercepted a forward pass
and ran it back a third of that distance. A sturdy
drive by Barrett brought fifteen more; a forward pass
netted another substantial gain; three line plunges left
Lakeville but twenty-five yards to go.</p>

<p>"Six&mdash;eight&mdash;five&mdash;seven&mdash;three!" cried
Bunny at quarter. Like well-oiled bits of machinery,
the Lakeville eleven clanked into the kick formation,
with Bunny back to receive the pass. Professor Leland
shook his head.</p>

<p>Rodman saw the gesture and understood. Because
the Lakeville team was lighter, the coach had ordered
a kicking game, with a try for goal from the field whenever
the eleven was well within the enemy's territory.
Twice before, however, Bunny's attempts had failed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
there was no reason to expect him to put the ball over
the goal this time.</p>

<p>The long pass was made and caught. Bunny
dropped the pigskin point-down, caught it with his toe
as it touched the ground, and kicked it toward the
looming goal posts. It went short and wide.</p>

<p>"He can't do it." The coach was talking for his
own benefit. "I was afraid he couldn't."</p>

<p>Rodman plucked up courage. "No, he can't, of
course. I knew he couldn't."</p>

<p>The coach turned to the substitute. "What do you
mean, Cree? I thought Payton was a friend of yours."</p>

<p>"He is, sir; my best friend. But don't you see why
he can't get off a good drop-kick?"</p>

<p>The whistle had blown to signal the end of the half.
Both teams were trooping off the field. But Professor
Leland, after turning as if to join the eleven, stopped
by Rodman's side.</p>

<p>"Look here, Cree, if you know any reason why Payton
can't kick as well in a game as he can in practice,
suppose you tell me now, before I instruct the boys not
to follow this plan of play in the second half."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'll tell you." Rodman's voice was joyous.
At last, he was able to do something worth while.
"Look at the sun. The game started late, and now
it shines toward the west goal, directly in Bunny's
eyes every time he kicks. See that sun? Then there's
the wind. It isn't much of a wind, sir, but it's kicking
up a lot of dust, which always blows toward Bunny&mdash;into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
his eyes. But that isn't all." His words came
fast; he was afraid the coach would leave before he
was done. "Those Grant City fellows, sir, have three
corking fine players at center and guards, and our line
doesn't take care of them. They get Roundy excited
and nervous, and he passes the ball high and wild.
That means the kick is sent off in a good deal more of
a hurry than it should be. And Buck isn't playing
close enough to the line to stop that right tackle."</p>

<p>Professor Leland nodded. "I believe you are right,
Cree. I've noticed a few of those points myself, but
you've seen more than I have. All right; we'll give
Bunny another chance at a goal from the field."</p>

<p>The talk between halves to the team was full of encouragement.
"We're doing well," the coach told
them; "mighty well. But we are going to do just a
little better. We must score on that team, and we must
hold it. Now in this business of field goals&mdash;"</p>

<p>To the unmixed delight of Rodman, Professor Leland
made use of the very arguments which the substitute
had brought up a minute before. "When they
kick off to us this half, as they will, I want the ball
rushed down the field to a point where we can try another
drop for goal. Then, Payton, because we shall
have changed goals, your eyes will be free of dust;
Claxton will handle that tackle; Jones and Turner will
take care of the combination at center, which will allow
you, Magoon, to make the best pass of your life. We
can do it all, I know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>As the boys stretched out to rest for the remainder
of the period, Rodman's satisfaction was marred by
only one thought. Although he had done his part to
aid the team, neither Bunny nor the others knew anything
about it. And it was their friendship and respect
he wanted.</p>

<p>"Old Leland is the boy!" Roundy commented lazily
to Bunny. "He saw what was wrong, and he fixed it
up, too. He's the kind of coach to have."</p>

<p>"We all know that," Bunny responded fervently.</p>

<p>"Why, you can't kick into the sun and dust any more
than you can fly; but I couldn't tell him so."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Rodman's tongue to explain the
origin of the suggestion. In spite of the impulse, however,
he kept silent.</p>

<p>"All ready to save the day, Cree?" jeered Buck.
"You'd be all right, at that, except that you'd probably
stumble over the whitewash on the goal line and
drop the ball."</p>

<p>It was hard to keep his temper under these flings
with which Buck Claxton favored him from time to
time. So far as his naturally friendly nature was
capable of hating anybody, Rodman had begun to hate
Buck. Above everything else, he was glad that Professor
Leland was the coach, instead of Buck, and that
he himself was working for the whole school and not
for Buck Claxton.</p>

<p>At the same time, he admitted to himself that Buck
was not a bad captain, despite his tendency to fumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in a crisis. With Roundy Magoon at center, Turner
and Bi Jones at guards, Kiproy and Collins at tackles,
Sheffield and Jump Henderson at ends, and a back
field composed of Barrett and Collins at halves, Buck
Claxton at full, and Bunny at quarter, the Lakeville
High football team was developing into a snappy, hard-fighting
eleven. They were sure of themselves.</p>

<p>When the whistle called them out on the field again,
Rodman noted that they trotted forth with a jauntiness
which matched very favorably the do-or-die expression
of the Grant City players.</p>

<p>"Everybody in it!" shouted Buck, as the team made
ready to receive the kick-off.</p>

<p>Jump caught the punt, running back the ball at an
angle and passing it to Sheffield, who drilled to the
middle of the field before he was stopped. Capping
this gain came a series of short, sharp plunges, till
the distance to Grant's goal was halved.</p>

<p>"Six&mdash;eight&mdash;seven&mdash;five&mdash;thirteen!"</p>

<p>At the warning of the key number, seven, Bi and
Turner crowded closer to Roundy at center, while Buck
played close to the line to block a threatening tackler.
Guarded on both sides, with wind and sun at his back,
and with a sure, swift pass to handle, Bunny drop-kicked
a perfect goal.</p>

<p>The first points had been scored. The count stood:
Lakeville, 3; Grant City, 0.</p>

<p>The crowd, made up largely of Lakeville people,
shouted joyously, threw hats into the air, and celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
with much squawking of auto horns. After she
had yelled herself hoarse, Molly climbed from the
Sefton car to exchange a word with Rodman.</p>

<p>"Isn't it glorious?" she cried. "We're winning
our first game. S. S. told me what Professor Leland
said about Bunny's kicking. Wasn't that just too
smart for anything?"</p>

<p>Rodman's face lengthened. He wanted very much
to tell Molly that the advice was the result of his observations.
But something, he could not tell what,
checked the words.</p>

<p>"We're getting them, all right," he said, instead.
"All we have to do now is to hold when they begin to
batter against our line."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can do that." Molly nodded confidently.
"You wait and see."</p>

<p>Following the kick-off, the battle raged uncertainly
in the middle of the field. Near the end of the third
quarter, however, Grant City took the ball on downs,
and began a steady onslaught that was formidable.
Then, when the Lakeville line seemed to have braced,
Rodman came to his feet like a puppet on a string.
There it was again! Grant was calling for its trick
play.</p>

<p>"Signal! What's the signal?" called a confused
voice. "All ready, Bert?" "Dig into 'em!"
"Signal?" "Wait a minute!" "Hold it!" "Signal!"</p>

<p>Grant's right guard and tackle stood up straight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
their places, looking helplessly toward the quarterback.</p>

<p>"Signal?"</p>

<p>Like the flare of a flashlight, the mystery cleared in
Rodman's mind. Why, of course, that was the answer!
Why couldn't Buck solve it, or Bunny, or some
one of those players in the Lakeville line, already
glancing up at the confused babel of voices. Surely,
they must see through such an obvious device.</p>

<p>They must&mdash;No! Back whirled the ball; forward
shot the compact interference and runner. Before the
wiry half was tackled, he had covered a cool fifteen
yards. It was first down again for Grant.</p>

<p>An unworthy thought burned in Rodman's brain.
Why should he tell Coach Leland about the play?
Why not put the problem squarely up to the squad at
the end of the quarter, when, by previous agreement, it
would be permissible to talk with them? In that way,
all of the fellows would see they had been mistaken in
him; would be forced to realize that he was some
good, even if he couldn't make the team. Why should
he allow the coach another chance to walk off with
borrowed laurels?</p>

<p>His forehead creased with trouble wrinkles while his
conscience wrestled with the question. No-o!...
It wouldn't be the thing to do, after all. He was still
a member of the football squad. As such, it was his
business to acquaint the coach, or whoever was in
charge of the team, with any helpful information.
Simple loyalty demanded that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"First down; ten yards to gain!"</p>

<p>As he foresaw, Grant did not attempt the trick again.
It was a clever play, but its abuse would certainly lead
to discovery. Probably, indeed, if they were shrewd&mdash;and
somebody with brains was undoubtedly in command
of the visiting eleven!&mdash;they would not try it
until they were within striking distance of the goal.
Then, unless checked, it would mean a sure touchdown
and the game.</p>

<p>Twice more Grant City made small gains. As they
lined up for the next play, time was called, with the
ball in possession of the visiting team on Lakeville's
thirty-yard line.</p>

<p>Rodman started. He must warn the coach at once.</p>

<p>"Professor Leland!"</p>

<p>At that very moment, Mr. Gorse, who was refereeing,
called to the coach.</p>

<p>"Just a second, Cree." Throwing a hasty word of
advice to the team, the coach started across the field
toward the referee.</p>

<p>Fifteen seconds passed. Professor Leland was still
arguing some point with Mr. Gorse. Thirty seconds!
The conversation went on.</p>

<p>Well, if he couldn't talk to the coach, he must put
the matter squarely before the next man under him.
But the person now in charge of the team was Buck
Claxton; and Buck&mdash;well, Buck was Buck! He
couldn't bring himself to tell Buck anything. He
even started to squat again on his blanket, when, quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to his own surprise, he found himself walking over to
the side of the captain. After all, as long as he practiced
with the squad, he must be loyal.</p>

<p>"Oh, Buck!"</p>

<p>"Well?" snapped Claxton. "What d'ye want?"</p>

<p>Rodman hesitated, tempted at the last second to turn
back with the message undelivered. But once more a
better impulse prevailed. In a voice purposely low,
that the others might not overhear, he offered his explanation.</p>

<p>"That play where the whole Grant team gets to
talking before the ball is passed&mdash;watch it! I thought
first it was some trick, but it's really only a straight
plunge by their half. The reason they gain is because
they throw you fellows off by yelling for the signal
and all that. Part of the line stands up and looks
at the quarterback. You all think they are mixed on
the signal, but they aren't. The reason it works is
because they catch our team when it doesn't expect the
ball to be passed, when our own guard and tackle have
straightened up a little, too, to see what's going on.
Yes, they do! I've been watching 'em. But they
don't realize it."</p>

<p>Buck tried vainly to interrupt, but there was no
checking the torrent of Rodman's words.</p>

<p>"They get all your attention off the game, and then,
bingo! the ball is put in play. It's a fact, Buck! Remember
now, if they start jabbering at each other, and
one side of the line begins to stand up straight, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
means the play is going right through there. Remember
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was still talking earnestly when the whistle blew,
with Buck, his face stolid, staring steadily at the ground
and scraping marble rings in the dust with his right
shoe-toe.</p>

<p>"Ready, Lakeville!" shouted the captain; and the
game was on again.</p>

<p>A lucky fumble brought the ball into the home
team's hands, and Bunny punted out of danger. After
that, steadily and surely, with all the advantages of
weight and experience, the Grant eleven began to
grind its way down the field. Desperately, Lakeville
crouched and set itself; still more desperately, Grant
City ploughed onward. The formations were slow
and deliberate; the visitors risked no fumble or error.
Often the gains were only a foot or two, but each
fourth down found another ten yards covered. Rodman
realized that some keen brain was directing the
team, balancing time against gains, and playing for one
touchdown that would turn the threatened defeat into
a victory.</p>

<p>"Curtains!" groaned Specs somewhere in the background,
quite loudly enough for Rodman to hear.
"Curtains! Hold 'em, fellows! Hold 'em!"</p>

<p>"Three minutes to play!" announced Horace Hibbs.</p>

<p>"If we can only hold them from that goal!" muttered
Coach Leland.</p>

<p>"Grant's ball! First down; ten yards to gain!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>A plunge through center netted three of them; a
wriggling half eeled around right end for another two;
the same play on the other side brought the total to
eight. Lakeville was fighting gallantly, but superior
weight was beginning to tell.</p>

<p>"Fourth down; two yards to gain."</p>

<p>Already the ball was in the very shadow of the goal
posts. If this final attack succeeded, it meant a touchdown.
Rodman Cree shivered in his blanket. Suppose
they tried the trick play now. Would Buck&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Billy?" "Ready there,
Chick!" "Signal!" "What's the signal?" "Never
mind!" "Hold her!"</p>

<p>The right tackle and guard of the Grant City team
straightened up.</p>

<p>"Signal?" called a bewildered voice.</p>

<p>Rodman gripped his fists tight. Was it to go
through, even after he had warned Buck? But suddenly,
hard and high above the din from the Grant line,
the Lakeville captain's voice rang clear:</p>

<p>"Get down, Bi! On the job, Kiproy! They're
coming through you! It's the right half! Everybody
together now! <i>Stop him!</i>"</p>

<p>The ball was snapped. Like a battering-ram, the
right half of the Grant team, pocketed in perfect interference,
catapulted against the Lakeville line,&mdash;against
Bi and Kiproy, backed by Peter Barrett and
Buck Claxton. For just the fraction of a second, the
line wavered, threatening to snap. Then it tautened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
into a stone wall, against which the runner crashed and
fell back. There was no gain. The trick had failed.
It was Lakeville's ball almost on her goal line.</p>

<p>Bunny punted out of danger. Grant City had just
time to line up for one weak charge before the whistle
announced the end of the game. By checking that
one play, Lakeville had prevented a touchdown and had
won, 3 to 0.</p>

<p>In the minds of the victorious players, there was no
doubt as to the fellow who deserved the credit. Scouts
and all, they hoisted Buck to their shoulders, cheering
him as they marched around the field.</p>

<p>From where he stood, Rodman Cree could see Molly
leaning from the car and waving her pennant. On the
side lines, Clarence Prissler was executing a war dance
of his own. In the midst of a group of girls, Marion
Genevieve Chester was leading the school cheer. And
it was all for Buck!</p>

<p>Nobody knew what Rodman had done, of course,
except the coach and Buck; and evidently they weren't
going to tell. For a bitter moment, Rodman argued
with himself. Should he go on with the thankless
job?</p>

<p>Across his brain flashed the memory of a sentence he
had read in the Scouts' "Handbook", "<i>A Scout is
loyal.</i>" It was one of the twelve laws; it meant him,
too, whether he was a Scout or not. It was a law that
applied to everybody all over the world. He didn't
have to be a Scout to keep that law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>With a stiffening of his shoulders, he lifted his head,
as if to stare all Lakeville in the face.</p>

<p>"I'm going to keep on," he said, "whether anybody
knows what I am doing or not. I may not be a
Scout, but I'm as loyal as any one of them. I am
loyal to the school, and to the team, and to everybody
who has a claim on me. Yes, and I am going to keep
on being loyal."</p>

<p>They were giving three cheers for Buck now, with
Specs, clad in his street clothes, leading them all. Before
he knew it, Rodman was adding his voice to the
praise.</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't be anything else," he said suddenly.
"I wouldn't be anything else."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE PEACE PICNIC</p>

<p class="pn p2">This is the story of Molly Sefton's great peace picnic,
which was held on the following Saturday afternoon.
It didn't seem funny at the time; in fact, nobody could
have been more serious or in earnest than Molly when
she planned the picnic. But afterward&mdash;!</p>

<p>At any rate, here is what happened:</p>

<p>In the first place, the game with Grant City had done
one very good thing, among many others. After seeing
Buck stop Grant's trick play, Master Specs changed
his mind about not muddying a football suit that season.
He would not admit, of course, that Buck could
compare with Bunny; but he began to feel that Buck
had some good points, after all. So he was back in
the squad, trying hard for an end position and with a
fair chance of winning the place. That was one difficulty
ironed out.</p>

<p>"But here's the reason for the picnic," Molly chattered
to Bunny the day before. "First, I want the
Black Eagle Patrol to like Rodman Cree; and, second,
I want the rest of the school to like you Scouts. Now if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
we have a nice, jolly picnic, everybody will get acquainted
and understand everybody else. You see,
they all have wrong ideas about each other. For instance,
Specs thinks Rodman isn't good for anything."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I," admitted Bunny cautiously, "he isn't
much of a track athlete or football player."</p>

<p>"But he can play baseball. I know he can. I saw
him bat the first day of school, even if he does say he
hit the ball accidentally."</p>

<p>Bunny agreed. "All right. We'll take along a
bat and ball and a couple of gloves, and maybe Specs
and the others will like him better after they see him
play."</p>

<p>"Of course." Molly was growing more and more
enthusiastic. "As for the others: Peter Barrett thinks
you are a lot of snobs and won't associate with fellows
who happen to have patches on their clothes and that
kind of thing; Buck Claxton says that you try to run
things, and that if anybody outside the patrol has a
plan, you oppose it, just because you didn't happen to
think of it first; Royal Sheffield thinks you are a bunch
of sissies, who don't dare walk across the road without
asking permission from your Scout Master; Genevieve
Chester says you hate her because she was elected president
of the student association, and are always hoping
something awful will happen to her; Clarence Prissler
honestly believes you never think of a thing but athletics,
and aren't interested in books or education&mdash;and
you know he is planning to be a teacher." Molly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
paused to take breath. "Now, I say that if we have a
nice, lively, get-acquainted picnic, everybody will find
out his mistakes. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Whatever Bunny really thought made no difference,
because the picnic was already under way; and at precisely
two o'clock Saturday afternoon some thirty-five
boys and girls, accompanied by Mrs. Sefton, boarded
three borrowed launches and crossed the lake to Turkey
Point.</p>

<p>And this is how everybody succeeded in misunderstanding
everybody else.</p>

<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Specs Found He had been Mistaken in Rodman
Cree</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">"How about playing a little scrub ball?" proposed
Bunny at three-fifteen that afternoon. "You come in
on this, Rodman."</p>

<p>Rodman Cree wrinkled his nose in perplexity. "But
I can't play baseball. You know I can't. I've told
you so."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats! You knocked a home run that first day
of school, and you can do it again. Come on, Buck;
let's choose up."</p>

<p>The game lasted only three innings, for by that time
the girls had started a marshmallow roast; but it was
quite long enough. In the first inning, Rodman played
third until he had muffed two perfect throws, when
Bunny shifted him to the outfield. Here he misjudged
an easy fly and strained to correct his error by throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the ball twenty feet over the head of Bi, who was wildly
trying to nip a runner at second.</p>

<p>At bat, in the third inning, with two out, bases full,
and Bob Kiproy pitching a straight ball, poor Rodman
had his last shred of reputation removed.</p>

<p>Three times Kiproy pitched wide, high balls. Rodman
scraped the dust trying to hit, and lunged two feet
across the plate trying to hit, and jumped high in the
air trying to hit.</p>

<p>And he never touched the ball.</p>

<p>"I see I was mistaken," observed Specs, as he walked
in from third, where he had been stranded high and dry
as a runner. "I thought he was some good at baseball,
anyhow, but he's no good at anything."</p>

<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Peter Barrett Observed the Way Scouts Regarded
Patched Clothes</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">At four o'clock Peter Barrett was walking in a little
grove back of an open field, attempting to memorize
a poem for Monday's class. Also, between times, he
was endeavoring to be fair to the Black Eagle Patrol;
for a talk with Molly had convinced him that perhaps
he had made a mistake in supposing the Scouts to be
snobs. At this juncture, he caught sight of Bunny,
legs apart, talking defiantly to a ragged youngster from
the nearest farm.</p>

<p>"No, you can't come in here," Bunny was saying
shortly. "We have this place for the afternoon. You
will have to go somewhere else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I won't hurt anything."</p>

<p>Bunny became even sharper. "I've told you already
to go home. Run along now. We don't want
you here, and you know why. Hurry up!"</p>

<p>Reluctantly and sorrowfully, the boy in the ragged
clothes turned and slouched back to the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Peter Barrett grimly to himself.
"Just what I thought right along. They're snobs.
They haven't any use at all for poor folks."</p>


<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Buck Claxton Tested the Scouts' Willingness to
Co-operate with Outsiders</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">Five o'clock had come, with the time for serving the
lunch brought by the girls still two hours away, when a
bright idea dawned on Buck Claxton.</p>

<p>"What do you say to this?" he began enthusiastically
to Roundy. "About a quarter of a mile down the
road, there is a little store where they sell ice cream.
Suppose we all chip in and buy enough for the crowd?
It would be a nice thing to do."</p>

<p>Roundy's face assumed a wistful expression, and he
nodded his head. "But I&mdash;I'm afraid I can't," he
declined.</p>

<p>Buck turned to Nap. "How about you?"</p>

<p>"Waterloo!" said Nap firmly. "Can't think of it!"</p>

<p>"Busted!" added S. S. lamely.</p>

<p>Four other Scouts gave the same answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" remarked Buck, with a superior
smile on his face. "I'll see some of the others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, he came back with ice cream for everybody.
But no Scout had paid for even one little frozen
chunk.</p>


<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Royal Sheffield Discovered Whether the Scouts
Dared Cross the Road Without Asking Permission</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">At five-thirty, to the west of the picnic grounds,
Royal Sheffield and S. S. observed a husky young
farmer blazing away at a tin can with a rifle.</p>

<p>"That's my cousin," observed S. S.</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed Sheffield. "We'll borrow the
rifle, pay for some cartridges, and have a big shooting
match."</p>

<p>S. S. seemed troubled. "I don't think we ought to
do that," he objected. "Horace Hibbs isn't here, and
somebody might get hurt."</p>

<p>Sheffield stared in amazement. "We would shoot at
a target, of course," he explained.</p>

<p>S. S. continued stubborn. "There are too many of
us. Somebody might get shot."</p>

<p>"Tell you what we will do, then: you and I will
slip over there and get him to give us a couple of
shots."</p>

<p>S. S. was more embarrassed than ever. "No, I
don't think we ought to do that, either, Roy. No, we
certainly ought not to do that." He turned toward the
picnic crowd. "Let's get back to the bunch. Maybe
they are starting something. Yes, let's go back."</p>

<p>"All right!" snorted Sheffield contemptuously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
"But it's too bad Horace Hibbs won't be here when we
eat."</p>

<p>"Why?" S. S. asked innocently.</p>

<p>"If he isn't here, how will you know whether you
may eat two kinds of sandwiches and cake, and how
hot you may drink your coffee?"</p>

<p>And Royal Sheffield walked away, leaving S. S. without
an answer.</p>


<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Marion Genevieve Chester Proved (to Her Own
Satisfaction) How Much the Scouts Cared for Her</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">It was ten minutes past six when Bi and Marion
Genevieve Chester, very gay in her new red dress,
started over to a little spring to get water for the
coffee. Bi suggested skirting the rail fence to the lane,
instead of cutting across fields.</p>

<p>Marion Genevieve tossed her head. "What's the
use of being in the country if you can't walk on the
grass. You go any way you want to. I'm going
straight across."</p>

<p>Bi's shoe had become untied, and he was stooping to
lace it when wild screams, mingled with angry bellowing,
came from the field into which Marion Genevieve
had ventured. Looking up, he saw the girl dashing
toward the fence, her mouth open and her eyes wide
with fright. Meanwhile, the bellowings grew loud and
furious.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're all right," he called, as she reached the
fence. "You have plenty of time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>For a bit, due to her frightened exhaustion, it looked
as if Marion Genevieve might not be able to climb over
the fence. Bi sauntered toward her.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "You're all right."</p>

<p>"If I am all right," snapped Marion Genevieve, once
more out of the field, "it's not your fault. For all you
cared, that bull could have tossed me over, and you
wouldn't have made a move to help me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I believe you knew the bull was in there all
the time, and you never said a word about it." She
pointed her finger at him. "Didn't you know the bull
was in there?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the hapless Bi. "I did, of course,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't you ever dare to speak to me again, you
hateful boy."</p>

<p>And with this farewell, Marion Genevieve Chester
flounced angrily back to the picnickers, leaving Bi and
the pail by the side of the fence.</p>

<p class="pn center p1"><i>How Clarence Prissler Interviewed the Scouts to Learn
Their Views on Educational Matters</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">It was the shouts of laughter that drew Molly to the
bit of sandy beach near the boat landing. Lunch was
ready, and she crossed over to let the jolly ones know
about the coming meal.</p>

<p>There were three principal actors and two spectators
in the group. Specs, Jump and little Prissler stood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
line on the sand, while Bob Kiproy and Jim Collins,
stretched at full length, were doing most of the laughing.
Around Prissler's waist circled a sort of rope
harness, with a dangling line on each side. These ends,
at the moment when the boy began his somersault in
the air, were grasped by Jump and Specs.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to try it again," whined Clarence
Prissier. "I'm not going to; that's all there is
to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're coming along in fine style," said Jump
comfortably. "Never mind those fellows. Just try
it once more."</p>

<p>"Go on," Specs commanded. "We're waiting."</p>

<p>"Yes, try it again, Prissy," said Kiproy feebly, between
shrieks of laughter.</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're waiting," snapped Specs, giving the rope a
tug.</p>

<p>Prissier bent his knees, swung back his arms, and
then, with a desperate leap, essayed a back flip through
the air. It was not forceful enough, however, and he
came down on his hands and knees. Though Specs
and Jump kept him from crashing, he landed hard
enough to lurch forward into the sand.</p>

<p>Kiproy and Collins rolled over in violent laughter.</p>

<p>"You're getting it," said Jump encouragingly.
"You're getting it."</p>

<p>"Sure, you're getting it," agreed Specs.</p>

<p>"But I tell you, I don't want to get it," protested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Prissier, rubbing the sand out of his clothes. "And
what's more, I'm not going to do it again."</p>

<p>Molly interrupted. "Lunch is ready," she said, in
a voice so different from her ordinary tones that Specs
looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he ventured, after Clarence
Prissier, still weakly complaining, had managed to slip
the rope from his waist and was walking with the others
toward the spread tablecloths.</p>

<p>"You know well enough what the matter is," said
Molly severely; "and if you're not ashamed. I'm
ashamed for you." Deliberately, she turned her back
on him.</p>

<p class="p2">The balance of the evening was not a success.
Though the picnic lunch would have satisfied anybody,
the picnickers felt ill at ease. The Scouts were uncomfortable,
and Buck, Barrett, Sheffield, Prissier
and Company were more so, to say nothing of Marion
Genevieve Chester. Even the launch ride around the
lake, which ended the picnic, was a dismal failure, because
nobody seemed to want to sing. When the party
broke up, it made about as much noise as so many homeward-bound
rabbits.</p>

<p>Almost in tears, Molly Sefton walked home with
her mother, accompanied by Bunny as basket bearer.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it all went wrong." Molly was very near
sobbing as she said good night. "Oh, why did you do
it? I tried so hard, and Specs and Bi and&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
everybody just went and spoiled everything. I heard
all about it."</p>

<p>Bunny looked genuinely astonished. "What did we
do that was wrong? You can't blame me because Rodman
can't play ball. I didn't know he was going to
pieces like that."</p>

<p>"It wasn't just Rodman. Why did you keep that
poor little boy with the ragged clothes from coming
over to the picnic? We had enough to eat for a dozen
more. Peter Barrett said you chased him away. Why
did you do it?"</p>

<p>Bunny heaved a sigh of relief. "There was a scarlet
fever sign on the house. When I found he lived there,
I told him to go away and stay away. I couldn't do
anything else, could I?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Molly. "But why wouldn't any
of you help buy the ice cream?"</p>

<p>"We spent our last cent paying for gasoline for
the three launches. We borrowed the boats, but we
had to pay for the gas. None of us had a penny
left."</p>

<p>"S. S. wouldn't borrow his cousin's rifle, even for a
single shot."</p>

<p>"S. S. told me about that. He was right to argue
against bringing the gun over for any target shooting.
There were too many of us; it would have been dangerous.
But it would have been more dangerous for Roy
Sheffield if S. S. had taken him over where his cousin
was, though Roy doesn't know it. You see, about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
years ago, this cousin was driving in town, and Roy
threw a newspaper in front of the rig, which frightened
the horse so much it nearly ran away. The fellow has
had it in for him ever since."</p>

<p>Molly thought for a moment. "Bi let Marion Genevieve
Chester get almost killed by a wild bull. He
knew it was in that field, and he saw that she had on a
red dress."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a bit of danger," Bunny laughed.
"The bull was tied up and fenced off from that field.
Anyhow, Marion Genevieve was never as close as fifty
yards to the bull. She never even saw it."</p>

<p>"You'll admit that was an awful thing they did to
poor little Clarence Prissler."</p>

<p>Bunny grinned. "I was to blame for that. You
see, Molly, I thought it best not to tell the boys about
those people who don't like us, because I figured that
if we just acted natural they would find out that we
don't mean to be snobbish or stingy or anything else
low-down. But I did tell the Scouts about Prissy's
thinking we weren't interested in learning things. So
when Clarence went up to Jump and began to ask
questions about the circus, and how the acrobats got to
be acrobats, and all that, why, Specs insisted that Jump
teach Prissy the back flip. Honestly, Molly, I believe
Specs thought he was doing the right thing."</p>

<p>Molly and Bunny looked at each other. Then the
girl, brushing her hand across her eyes, broke into a
laugh, in which the boy joined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is funny," she said. "I didn't see it that way
before, but it is funny. Only everything's in a worse
tangle now than it ever was before."</p>

<p>"But we'll fix it," Bunny said. "We'll fix it somehow."</p>

<p class="pn p1">If Specs had not stopped on his way to school that
morning to play with Felix; and if Miss Seeby, the
botany teacher, had not expressed a desire for a specimen
of <i>aspidium fragrans</i>, which is a variety of fern;
and if Professor Leland had not called a mass meeting
for four o'clock that afternoon, there is no telling how
the day might have ended for the Black Eagle Patrol.</p>

<p>Felix was the Magoons' dog. He included in his
affections all friends of the family and particularly
Roundy's brother Scouts. There were people, indeed,
who claimed that Felix was the eighth member of the
patrol. But that was ridiculous, of course; for how
could a dog pass the tenderfoot tests of tying knots, or
take the Scout oath, or know the history of the flag?</p>

<p>Felix probably didn't worry about his official position.
What counted with him was the friendship of
the Scouts; and that morning, when care-free Specs
McGrew hove in sight, with a stick in his hand, Felix
barked happily and said, as plainly as a dog can,
"Throw it! I'll retrieve it for you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>So Specs whipped the stick fifty feet away, and Felix
rushed after it. As soon as he had thrown, Specs raced
for the corner, to get out of sight before the dog could
recover the bit of wood and return it. But Felix was
too quick for him, too wise in the game. All the way
to school they played it till, at the very door, with the
last bell ringing, Specs hurled it farther than he had
any time yet, and then took advantage of Felix by
dodging into the hall and running upstairs to his seat in
the big assembly room.</p>

<p>This was a mistake. The way to end a game with
Felix was to stand sternly before him and say, "Go
home, Felix; go home, sir!" and wait till the dog
dropped his tail between his legs and crept away.</p>

<p>The school day started like any other for Specs. He
answered "present" at roll call, joined the others in
singing, and listened attentively to the five-minute address
by Professor Leland. It was not until he had
marched with the class to Room 4 for his botany recitation,
indeed, that he thought of Felix again.</p>

<p>"The <i>aspidium fragrans</i>, or fragrant fern," Miss
Seeby was saying, "is a rare and hardy little species,
growing in clefts on the faces of precipices. It is aromatic,
with an odor said to be like new-mown hay composed
largely of sweet-briar rose leaves. This fern
is to be found in our State, and I should like very much
to have a specimen to show the class. Look for a place
where there is a bare cliff, overhanging a little, perhaps,
so the rain cannot reach the plant, and up above all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
trees, so that it can have no shade at all. If you find
a fern there, test it by its fragrance, its stickiness and
its beautiful brown, curling fronds." She paused,
walked toward Specs and said, in a wholly different
voice, "Is that your dog?"</p>

<p>Specs looked down. Faithful Felix had evidently
followed him through the hall when he left the assembly
room and was now lying beside his desk, thumping an
eager tail against the floor. His unexpected presence
provoked discreet mirth from everybody except the
teacher and Specs himself.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no ma'am. It's the Magoons'." Common
honesty made him add, "But he followed me to school,
I guess. I was playing with him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Miss Seeby, looking more offended
than ever. "<i>Indeed!</i> Well, put him out&mdash;<i>immediately</i>!"</p>

<p>Specs coerced Felix into the hall and warned him to
go home and behave himself like a good dog. But
there must have been meekness and apology in the command;
for, instead of obeying, Felix went only as far
as the outer corridor, where he slunk into a dark comer.
Two minutes later, in any event, he was scratching at
the classroom door and whining for admittance.</p>

<p>Miss Seeby had just shown her pupils a drawing of
the fragrant fern and asked again that any one who
knew where it was to be found secure a specimen at the
first opportunity. She paused suddenly, and her face
hardened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take that dog away," she ordered Specs; "yes,
take him home. And you need not come back to school
yourself until you have a note from your father to Professor
Leland, stating that you are sorry for this outrage
and promising that you will not bring that animal
here again."</p>

<p>Very penitent, although somewhat confused over the
exact nature of his guilt, Specs rose and made dizzily
for the door. As he closed it behind him, he could hear
the giggling of the class and a smothered reference&mdash;he
credited it to Rodman Cree&mdash;about "Mary's little
lamb", interrupted by the teacher's sharp admonition
for silence.</p>

<p>To Specs' credit, be it recorded that he followed instructions
to the best of his ability. With an affectionate
twist of Felix's ear, he strode down the hall and
outdoors, even forgetting his cap in his hurry, with the
dog tagging at his heels. Straight to the Magoons' he
led Felix; sternly he told him to stay there. Then he
ambled downtown, to explain to his parent as best as he
could the disgrace that had befallen him.</p>

<p>"Your father's out in the country," the clerk in the
McGrew hardware store told him. "He'll be back
in an hour or two, though."</p>

<p>Deep thought slowed Specs' steps on the return trip.
In front of the Magoons' the forgiving Felix crept out
and made it plain he was sorry and wanted to be friends
again. The Scout stared at him with a slow smile.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he called. "I can't go back to school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
till I get that note, and I can't get that note till father
comes back to town. Tell you what, Felix; you and I
will chase out along the lake shore and find one of those
smelly ferns for Miss Seeby. I know where they grow.
Come on, old boy!"</p>

<p>Directly after school that afternoon, as has been intimated,
Professor Leland called a mass meeting. After
Marion Genevieve Chester, as president of the student
association, rapped for order, the principal rose
from his chair on the platform and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"To-morrow afternoon," he began, "Lakeville High
School plays its second football game. I have called
this meeting to suggest that we organize to encourage
the team during the game. We made enough noise at
the other; but some of us cheered at the wrong times,
when it wasn't quite fair to our opponents, and not at
the right times, when it might have heartened our own
boys; and some of us cheered all by ourselves, without
any attempt to swell the volume of applause and encouragement.
What I wish to suggest is practicing the
Lakeville cheer, till we can pour it forth like the
<i>boom-boom-boom</i> of a cannon, and the appointing of
cheer leaders for the different sections."</p>

<p>Nominations were promptly offered, and the candidates
as promptly elected. Profiting by that other
meeting, the Scouts made no attempt to win a place.</p>

<p>"I wonder," continued Professor Leland, "if all of
us realize that we may help, even if we are not playing
on the team itself. Let me show you what I mean."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, while Bunny and Buck listened just a little
more intently than the others, perhaps, he told them of
the drop-kicks that had failed in the first game because
of wind and dust and bad passes, and how Rodman
Cree had pointed out the handicaps and made possible
the goal when the teams changed sides.</p>

<p>A little applause rippled over the room. Everybody
squirmed about in his seat to see how Rodman took it,
but it was soon evident that the boy had not attended
the meeting.</p>

<p>"The Grant City team," went on the speaker, "had
a curious and effective trick formation, which was
solved by our boys in the nick of time, thanks to Captain
Claxton. Now, if some one of us who was not
playing had discovered that trick and warned our team,
it would have helped."</p>

<p>"Mr. Chair&mdash;I mean, Miss Chairman!"</p>

<p>It was Buck Claxton who interrupted. Very embarrassed
he looked as he stood there, and very white,
but very determined, too.</p>

<p>"Mr. Claxton," recognized Marion Genevieve Chester.</p>

<p>"Somebody did discover that trick," blurted Buck.
"Rodman Cree did. He told me about it between
quarters. That was why I knew what to expect.
That&mdash;that's all." He sat down with an audible
thump.</p>

<p>Very wisely, Professor Leland dismissed the subject
with a brief, "Then we have something more for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
which to thank Cree," and turned to another subject.
"Suppose we practice the Lakeville cheer now," he
said. "Let's shake the rafters."</p>

<p>If the cheers inspired by the new leaders did not
actually shake the rafters, it was because the school
building was new and rigid. They echoed and re-echoed
from basement to attic; they forced Marion
Genevieve Chester to thrust hurried fingers into her
aristocratic ears; they made you believe that Lakeville
was the best and biggest and most loyal high school in
all the world. In some mysterious way, everybody
seemed to think he could help win the morrow's game
by yelling just a little bit louder than his neighbor.</p>

<p>At the door, as they filed out, Bunny Payton stopped
each member of the Black Eagle Patrol long enough to
say, "Scout meeting at the club house to-night. Seven
sharp. Be sure and come."</p>

<p>Roundy was the last to leave. "Seen Specs?"
Bunny asked him. The patrol leader was not in Miss
Seeby's nine-o'clock botany class and knew nothing of
the morning incident. "H'm! Neither have I.
That's funny. Well, don't forget the meeting."</p>

<p class="p2">Rodman Cree was not a Boy Scout, but Felix may
have overlooked this point. Perhaps he realized that
Rodman was worthy of his friendship, or perhaps it
was merely the cap in the boy's hand that drew him like
a magnet. Whatever the reason, at four that afternoon,
when school was dismissed, Felix ran straight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Rodman and tried to tell him, in dog language, that
something was wrong, and that it had to do with somebody
connected with Specs' cap, which Rodman had observed
hanging in the coatroom, although he knew its
owner had not returned since his exile from Miss
Seeby's botany class.</p>

<p>Felix nuzzled Rodman, yelped sharply and trotted
away. When the dog saw that he was not followed, he
came back again, very patient with the dull human who
couldn't understand plain signs, and repeated his actions.
But it was not till the third time that the boy
began to get an inkling of the truth. Felix clinched the
matter by sniffing at the cap held toward him, barking
excitedly, and racing off at full speed.</p>

<p>Rodman may not have been a Boy Scout, but he constructed
this problem and its answer with a deft brain.
Miss Seeby had asked for a specimen of the fragrant
fern, which grew on the sides of cliffs. Specs had been
sent away from school in disgrace, accompanied by
Felix. He had not returned. The only cliffs near
Lakeville were to the west, along the shore of the lake.
Felix had smelled Specs' cap and run in that direction.
It followed, as surely as two plus two make four, that
he was endeavoring to lead somebody to the missing
boy.</p>

<p>"Maybe poor Specs fell over a precipice and hurt
himself," Rodman said, shivering uneasily. "All
right, Felix, I'm coming. The old mass meeting can
go hang!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, while the dog kept to the road, there was
nothing that Rodman could do save follow. But later,
when Felix left the main highway where it curved to
avoid the sandstone cliffs near the lake, and began pushing
his eager nose through the underbrush and over
tangles of grass, the boy recognized that this was virgin
country. Specs could not have come that way without
unconsciously leaving signs for anybody who came afterward.</p>

<p>Where some less observant boy might have found
nothing, Rodman readily picked up the trail. A pebble,
lying with its damp side up, proved that a careless foot
had turned it over. A splatter of partially dried mud
on the trunk of a tree revealed that the passer-by had
left the spot some hours before. Broken branches,
their tips toward the lake, pointed the way like arrows.
Grass and leaves added their mute evidence by lying
brushed forward till their under sides showed. It was
comforting, at least, to be certain Specs had hiked over
this very stretch.</p>

<p>"Yes, he came this way," Rodman told Felix.
"Find him, old fellow!"</p>

<p>At the top of the wooded rise they had been ascending,
the hill culminated in barren knobs, which broke
off abruptly in sandstone cliffs, sheer to the lapping
water of the lake. In places, the rock was solid, save
for little dirt-filled crevices, from which hardy vegetation
sprouted; in others, the stone had crumpled into
fine sand, which day by day sifted downward till a niche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
had been formed in the solid wall. It was toward the
top of one of these indentations that Felix raced, with
Rodman hard on his heels.</p>

<p>Throwing himself flat on his stomach, the boy wriggled
to the edge and peered down. Some twelve or
fifteen feet below him, squatting on a narrow patch of
sand, Specs McGrew was engaged in disconsolately
tossing pebbles upon the placid bosom of the lake. On
either side of his little prison, the walls of the precipice
fell straight to the water's edge, apparently extending
for hundreds of yards in both directions. Specs was
safe enough, to be sure, but he was as effectually cooped
upon the tiny plot of sand by the smooth rock cliffs and
the deep lake as if the iron bars of a cage encompassed
him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Specs!"</p>

<p>The imprisoned boy looked up. "Oh, it's you," he
said sullenly. "Got a rope?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not! You'd have one if you were
a Scout. Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"How did you get down there?" Rodman asked.</p>

<p>"Fell down, you chump!" snapped Specs.</p>

<p>Rodman wanted to snap back, "Well, fall up here,
then!" But he fought back the temptation. Instead,
"Sit tight," he called, "and I'll have you out in a
jiffy."</p>

<p>Back in the woods, wild grapevines twined over the
trees. It was the work of only a few minutes to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and trim one eight or ten feet long and lower it over
the sandy cliff.</p>

<p>"Grab hold," he called to Specs, "and you can walk
up the side of this sloping sand-pit as easy as falling off
a log. Ready! Up you come! Steady there! Careful!
Careful! There you are, safe and sound and on
top of the world once more. Now, is there a fragrant
fern anywhere around here?"</p>

<p>At seven o'clock that evening the Boy Scouts of the
Black Eagle Patrol met in their clubhouse. Before
seven-thirty they had threshed out the problem of
electing another member, and there was not a dissenting
vote when the name of Rodman Cree was proposed to
fill the patrol roster.</p>

<p>"Which is just as it should be," Horace Hibbs approved.
"Unless every single one of us thinks he is
the best fellow for the place, he should not be invited
to join. Now, if Specs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Specs!" groaned Bi. "We'll never convert
Specs; no, not in a thousand years. He says Rodman
is no good, and I guess he'll grow long white whiskers
before he'll admit he's wrong. No, siree, if we wait
for Specs to make it unanimous, this patrol will be one
man shy the rest of its life."</p>

<p>"I wish," began Bunny, "that Specs&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was chopped short by the rattle of the
latch. As the Scouts turned, the door flung wide, and
Specs himself popped into the room.</p>

<p>"Come on in, Rodman," he called. "Say, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Rodman is a whiz. You know the cliffs out near Old
Baldy. Well, I fell down one of them this morning,
reaching for a fragrant fern, and Rodman came looking
for me. Found me, too, by following my trail
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Felix led me to him," Rodman said depreciatingly.</p>

<p>"Rats!" scorned Specs. "You did it. Felix didn't
make a grapevine rope, did he, and pull me up the cliff?
I guess not. And who reached down and plucked this
fern? Felix? Huh! Smell it, Bunny. Listen, fellows!
Rodman knows all the things we do about trailing,
and the woods, and the birds, and tying knots, and
making fires without matches, and&mdash;oh, everything.
I always told you he was all right!" Specs made this
statement gravely and sincerely; he had forgotten his
former opinion of the new boy. "Well, then, what's
the matter with making him a Scout in the Black Eagle
Patrol? Anybody object?"</p>

<p>He stared at them fiercely, defiantly, as if daring one
of them to protest. Nobody did. Horace Hibbs
stroked his chin in high glee.</p>

<p>"Rodman," the Scout Master said, "can you tie&mdash;let
me see&mdash;these knots: the square or reef, sheet-bend,
bowline, fisherman's, sheepshank, halter, clove hitch,
timber hitch and two half hitches?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know some others, too."</p>

<p>"And do you know the Scout laws, motto, sign,
salute and significance of the badge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about your country's flag. Do you know its
composition and history and the customary forms of
respect due it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The boy was both eager and confident
in his replies.</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs smiled. "One more question: Would
you like to join the Black Eagle Patrol of Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>There was no formal "Yes, sir!" this time. Instead,
Rodman Cree gulped once or twice, as if it were
difficult to speak, and then fairly shouted, "You bet I
would!"</p>

<p>"In that case," pronounced Horace Hibbs judicially,
fitting the tips of his fingers together, "I see no reason
why you should not take the tenderfoot tests at once.
Bunny, will you get us a rope?"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, when Specs rose to replenish
the dying flames in the great brick fireplace, his eyes fell
upon Rodman Cree.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" he laughed, "what's the use of wasting
our wood when that fellow's head is a regular bonfire?"
He paused to digest his remark. "Say&mdash;say, let's
call Rodman 'Bonfire' after this. It's a dandy name
for him."</p>

<p>Horace Hibbs glanced shrewdly across the table at
the recruit. "Do you mind?" he asked.</p>

<p>The boy grinned happily. "Of course, I don't.
I&mdash;I like it," said Bonfire Cree, tenderfoot of the
Black Eagle Patrol.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">HALLOWE'EN</p>

<p class="pn p2">Clarence Prissler lay motionless upon bed Number 9
in the free ward of the model little hospital that the
Fair Play Factory had built in Lakeville. The nurse
pointed him out to Bunny Payton, and the latter tiptoed
softly to the sick boy's side. Before Prissler
opened his eyes and looked up at him, the caller had
clenched his hands nervously and swallowed hard.
He wondered if he would be welcome, and what he
was going to say. In spite of the fact that Clarence
Prissler had been a schoolmate of his since the first of
the year, he hadn't exchanged a dozen sentences with
him in that time.</p>

<p>The misunderstanding at Molly's picnic had been
deplorable. On the following Monday morning, Bunny
had resolved to seek out the boy and apologize and explain;
in a way, that would be a Scouts' good turn. But
Prissler had not come to school that day. He was
missing again on Tuesday and the succeeding days of
that week. Saturday the football team played and beat
Elkana High, and the victory was enough to make a
fellow forget almost everything. Besides, nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
seemed to know what had become of Prissler; nobody,
indeed, seemed to have missed him. But when a second
week had faded into the past, and part of a third, Bunny
stirred into action.</p>

<p>Professor Leland gave him the first clue. With
something of an ache in his heart, Bunny went straight
to Horace Hibbs.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Scout Master, "he is in our hospital.
He has been very ill." The man looked thoughtfully
at Bunny. "Do you recall the seventh Scout law?" he
asked, and quoted it slowly, "'A Scout is friendly.'"</p>

<p>At the hospital now, while Bunny fumbled with his
cap, the halting conversation got under way. Prissler
was glad to see him; he said so very politely and very
meekly. After Bunny had told him how sorry he was
about the picnic incident, they talked of general topics.
Presently, though, there came another of the embarrassing
pauses.</p>

<p>"To-night's Hallowe'en, isn't it?" ventured Prissler.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Bunny. He fancied he detected
a note of wistfulness in the other's tone. "Why, yes;
so it is. I&mdash;I wish you could come out with us."</p>

<p>"I wish I could." The sick boy tried bravely to put
some simulation of enthusiasm in his voice, but failed.</p>

<p>Bunny rose to his feet. He couldn't imagine the
bookish and hermit-like Prissler skylarking with the
fellows; the boy didn't&mdash;well, didn't just "fit." He
wasn't "one of the crowd." But, of course, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
couldn't say that to a fellow who was sick. And you
could say something nice!</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Prissler," he proposed. "I'll
be your proxy to-night when we're out. I'll pretend,
you know, that I'm walking about on your legs, and
using your arms and your brain; and then to-morrow
I'll come again and tell you all the things you did&mdash;through
me, by proxy, you understand. It will be the
next best fun to your being actually one of the bunch,
won't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Prissler dutifully; "yes, I suppose
so." He held out a weak hand. "Well, good-by,
Bunny. It was fine of you to come and see me. Good-by."</p>

<p>Out in the hall, Bunny met Doctor Maxwell. A
sudden impulse made him stop the man.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, "I am a classmate of Clarence
Prissler's at the high school. Can you tell me how he
is getting along?"</p>

<p>The physician eyed him thoughtfully. "I am glad
you called upon him," he said presently. "The truth
is, young Prissler isn't recovering as he should; he
isn't building up in mind or body after his siege. I've
thought, once or twice, that he needed a more intimate
touch with the outside world; that's why I am glad
you called upon him. Nobody else has."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;well, sir, he isn't what you call a very popular
fellow in school," apologized Bunny. "Doesn't play
any games, and keeps to himself, you know, sir, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
seems to prefer his own company to anybody else's.
There isn't any&mdash;any danger that he won't get well,
is there, sir?"</p>

<p>"There is every danger," replied Doctor Maxwell
soberly. "He is in a weak, despondent condition,
from which he does not seem to be able to arouse himself.
He has no interest in what is going on, no apparent
desire to rally and grow stronger. If it were
possible to inject fresh enthusiasm into him, some
actual ambition to get up from his bed and out into the
world again, it would mean more than any attention
or medicine we can give him here. He&mdash;well, I'm
glad you called, anyhow. We shall hope for the best."</p>

<p>There was a big lump in Bunny's throat when he left
the hospital. It was as if the physician had accused
him of some deliberate neglect. After all, he had
failed in practice to observe that seventh Scout law.
He remembered times when he might have sung out a
cheery greeting to Prissler in the days that were past,
or stopped to chat with him a minute, or flung an arm
over his shoulder and walked a ways with him, as he
often did with the other fellows. But he hadn't done
any of these things; he hadn't even suspected that the
boy was hungry at heart for companionship, and
wanted to share in the joys and disappointments of
those about him.</p>

<p>Bunny Payton wasn't quite himself when he joined
the other Scouts that evening for the usual round of
Hallowe'en pranks. Two or three of them commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
upon his moody silence, and eventually he had to explain
that he couldn't free his mind of the picture of
Clarence Prissler in the hospital, lying pale and weak
and ready to give up on his white cot. He even told
them how he had proposed becoming Prissler's proxy
for the night; told them about it grimly, in short, jerky
sentences, as if he dared them to laugh at the idea.
None of them did.</p>

<p>The following afternoon, directly after school, he
called again to see the patient. This time he greeted
the sick boy boisterously, as he might an old friend.</p>

<p>"Here's a glass of jelly," he said, after he had
shaken hands. "Mrs. Lannigan sent it to you."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lannigan? Why, I&mdash;I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Bunny, "I think she means it as a
sort of thanks offering. Fact is, you helped her quite
a bit last night."</p>

<p>"I? How could I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did it by proxy. You see, we fellows went
out last night to celebrate Hallowe'en. We strolled
past Mrs. Lannigan's. Her gate was swinging loose
on one hinge, and sagging down the whole strip of
fence in front of her cottage. That wasn't right, of
course; our sense of the orderly told us that. So
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you took the gate with you, I suppose." Clarence
Prissler's lips pursed a little.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll confess that some of us thought of doing
just that. But we didn't. If we had been representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
ourselves alone, we might have yielded to the temptation
in a thoughtless moment. But, you know, I was
acting as your proxy. I said to myself, 'What would
Prissy do?' And so&mdash;well, anyhow, we satisfied our
sense of beauty by cautiously repairing that fence and
bolstering up that giddy gate. About the time we were
through, the good Mrs. Lannigan herself pounced upon
us; thought we were walking away with the whole
fence, I guess. When she realized what we had done,
she was inclined to weep. Women are funny that
way, you know. But she smiled at the same time, and
asked:</p>

<p>"'Who was responsible for this?'"</p>

<p>"'Clarence Prissler, over at the hospital,' I told her;
and then she thanked me for you, and insisted upon my
taking a glass of her new jelly for you, and she's coming
around to see you in a day or two, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sick boy lifted a protesting hand. Bunny saw
two faint pink spots on his cheeks. "But I wasn't
really responsible for what you did," he declared.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course, you were. I was your
proxy, and you had to stand or fall by my actions.
And I might have done something else&mdash;something
for which I should have been very sorry afterwards&mdash;if
I had been acting for myself only."</p>

<p>Prissler pondered this for a long minute. Then he
looked up at his caller quizzically. "Did I do anything
else last night?" he asked with genuine interest.</p>

<p>"Lots of things. You wheeled back to its old corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Pop Gan's peanut roaster, after some fellows&mdash;young
kids who didn't know any better&mdash;had run
away with it; and you enjoyed racing it back to its old
stand as much as you could if you'd been running
away with it. Pop's put a sack of goobers aside for
you, against the day when you'll come around personally
to call for it. And you took Mrs. Ginty's baby
carriage, that had strayed downtown, and put a sack
of potatoes in it, and wheeled that back home, too.
And you stopped one youngster who was forgetting
himself, and lectured him&mdash;oh, mightily eloquently&mdash;till
he saw things a little clearer, and insisted upon
joining your crowd. And you happened to be of service
to your old landlady."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stone?" The pink spots in Prissler's cheeks
vanished.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Stone. Seems your trunk had been
put out of your room, and you stopped to ask about it.
She didn't quite understand that you'd be home
shortly and make up the work you do to pay the rent of
your room. There were lots of chores undone, and you
got the crowd to pitch in and carry the wood to the
shed, and cut some kindling, and clean up the yard;
and then, over your protest, mind you, the fellows in
your crowd agreed to come around daily and do the
work you'd been doing, until you were able to do it
yourself. You said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Boy Scouts are going to do it, you mean."</p>

<p>"Well-l, yes. You said that would make you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
well in a hurry, and Mrs. Stone said she hadn't realized
how matters stood with you, and it didn't matter if
the fellows pitched in as your work proxies or not.
But they're going to, just the same."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Clarence Prissler softly. "Oh!" The
pink spots in his cheeks crimsoned suddenly&mdash;and the
color lasted.</p>

<p>"And you ran across little Jimmy Bobbs, too," continued
Bunny, smiling a little over the recollection.
"He was standing on a corner and looking mighty
lonesome, and when you invited him to fall in with the
other fellows in the bunch he jumped at the chance and
said 'Thank you!' away down in his throat. And he
turned out to be a dandy sort of fellow himself. Seems
he's wanted to know you for a long time; says you're
the smartest boy in school. He's coming around to the
hospital this afternoon to see if you'd mind his bucking
up on his studies with you as an audience. He thinks
it will help you to catch up and help him, too, at the
same time. Want to see him?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, yes, I certainly do. I&mdash;I've been
worrying a lot, Bunny, about my lessons."</p>

<p>"You needn't any more, then. Because Nap Meeker
is planning to do exactly the same thing. Wants to.
And all the other Scouts are coming to see you, too, if
you don't mind their crowding in here."</p>

<p>Prissler blinked his eyes. "I&mdash;I don't mind," he
said, with a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well, let's see. I think that was about all you did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Oh, yes, I nearly forgot Professor Leland. I think he
was a bit suspicious of our actions. Anyhow, he
loomed up suddenly in a dark spot and demanded to
know if we had done or were planning to do any ma&mdash;malicious
mischief. I just wish, Prissy, you could have
been there in your own body to hear yourself&mdash;your
proxy, I mean&mdash;deny any such intentions. Specs
McGrew asked if he didn't understand that you, Clarence
Prissler, were leading the crowd. Professor
looked at me kind of funny, and I had to explain. He
just smiled and begged our pardons, and said that if
he had known you were at our head, even in spirit, he
wouldn't have bothered to question us. He knew
you!"</p>

<p>There followed a brief silence. Bunny broke it by
remarking, in a careless manner:</p>

<p>"Now that Rodman Cree is a member of the Black
Eagle Patrol&mdash;you knew that, didn't you?&mdash;and almost
ready to be promoted from tenderfoot to second-class
Scout, he's beginning to worry about ever getting
to be a first-class one. You see, Prissler, before he can
be advanced, he must train some other boy to become
a tenderfoot, and he can't find anybody in town who
thinks enough of the Scouts to want to be one of them."</p>

<p>The boy on the bed squirmed uneasily.</p>

<p>"But when he does&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bunny!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;would he train me?" gasped Prissler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
"I&mdash;I think I am just beginning to understand you
Scouts, and&mdash;and"&mdash;the words came out in a torrent&mdash;"and&mdash;Oh,
Bunny, I want to be a Scout!"</p>

<p>Bunny jumped up and put a hand on the boy's
shoulder. "Why, Bonfire will be tickled to death to
train you; yes, sir, plumb tickled to death! Do you
mean it, Prissy?"</p>

<p>The sick boy could only nod dumbly, but there was
undeniable happiness in the eager bobs of his head.</p>

<p>For ten minutes more, the two were deep in the intricacies
of Scoutcraft. When Bunny finally rose to
go, the patient was breathing rapidly, and his cheeks
were flooded with color.</p>

<p>A day or two later, Bunny met Doctor Maxwell on
the street.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to understand young Prissler's
case," the physician said; "but he's taken the most
marvelous turn for the better. He will be out of the
hospital in a week now. As nearly as I can diagnose
the improvement, something has aroused his interest in
the outside world again. Something has restored his
faith in mankind, and made him want to live and help
and be helped. I suspect&mdash;" And the man laid an approving
hand on Bunny Payton's shoulder and left the
sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"By the way," he added, "what about Hallowe'en?
I forgot all about it, and nothing in the way of results
happened to remind me of the occasion. Didn't you
boys get out? Or was the night a failure?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were out, sir," said Bunny, grinning happily,
"and I think&mdash;in fact, I know&mdash;that there was never
a better nor a more successful Hallowe'en in this town.
Ask Clarence Prissler over at the hospital. He led our
crowd."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE TOUCHDOWN</p>

<p class="pn p2">Buck Claxton was genuinely worried. It was
Thursday of the week that was to end with the post-season
football game against Belden High, and the
practice was going all wrong. The little Boy Scout,
Bunny Payton, who as quarterback was the most important
cog in the machine, wasn't "delivering."</p>

<p>Because he was big and heavy, and because the regular
team needed defensive drill, Buck had been shifted
temporarily to the scrubs. And that was the reason,
also, why two very poor players, whose names do not
matter, had been substituted in the line. Coach Leland
wanted to test his backs on defense.</p>

<p>The scrubs were given the ball in the middle of the
field. The two elevens crouched, facing each other,
and awaited Specs' signal, which came presently, like
the crack of a whip. On the last number, the backs
broke into action. It was a line plunge, with Buck
carrying the ball.</p>

<p>The weak link in the first team's line snapped at once.
Bunny Payton, backing it up, gave ground and swerved
into the path of the runner. Buck, big, solid, a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
battering-ram when he was under way, looked as
if he might crush this ambitious tackier as easily as an
elephant might an ant in its path.</p>

<p>But the ant, who was Bunny, did not falter. As
Buck reached him, the boy leaped toward the runner,
tackling low and fiercely, and brought his opponent to
the ground with a tremendous thump.</p>

<p>Buck sat up presently. He was unhurt, except as to
pride. "Trying to lay me out?" he blazed. "You
needn't half kill a fellow to bring him down."</p>

<p>The look he gave Bunny made some of the other
substitutes shake their heads wisely. The little quarter
had offended his captain. It wasn't exactly diplomatic,
and&mdash;Well, they guessed he wouldn't try it
again.</p>

<p>But a few minutes later, when exactly the same situation
arose, they wondered what he would do. Again
Buck took the ball on a straight line plunge; again his
interference swept aside the other tacklers of the secondary
defense, leaving only the shunted Bunny as a
possible danger.</p>

<p>Runner and tackler met. The two came together
with a crash. Buck staggered forward blindly, tottered,
caught himself once, and then fell heavily.
Bunny rebounded from the shock, but he did not plunge
to the ground. Instead, a very remarkable thing happened.</p>

<p>In the very twinkling of an eye, so sudden was the
transformation, Bunny ceased to be a tackler and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
a runner. In some mysterious manner, the ball
that Buck had been carrying, snuggled in the crook of
his arm, was now the other's.</p>

<p>There appeared to be no tardy recognition of the
shift on Bunny's part. Even as Buck was falling, the
quarterback started racing down the field toward his
goal. The point of the ball was tucked into his armpit.
His hand clasped the other end. The biceps of his arm
pressed hard against the rough surface.</p>

<p>Bunny could run like a deer. Before the astonished
scrubs could recover their wits, he was flashing past,
dodging now and then, circling some more alert tackler,
pushing off another with a moist palm, but always
sprinting over the white lines that marked the field.</p>

<p>But the surprising play was not yet done. Without
any apparent reason, the runner slowed to a trot and
finally stopped altogether. Specs rushed up and tackled
him apologetically.</p>

<p>A certain touchdown had been sacrificed by Bunny
on some mad impulse.</p>

<p>The little crowd of rooters that fringed the field
babbled its consternation and disgust. The scrubs
smiled knowingly at each other. Coach Leland plucked
off the players who had piled on the boy with the ball,
and then yanked the youngster to his feet with a practiced
hand.</p>

<p>"What made you stop?" he demanded hotly. If
there was one thing more than another that angered
the coach, it was an exhibition of mental stupidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunny looked down the field; down to where Buck
was striding forward belligerently. Scrubs and regulars
alike bent forward to listen. When he spoke, he
faced the coach squarely.</p>

<p>"I committed a foul," he said slowly. "When I
started to tackle Buck, I saw that he was holding the
ball loosely. It had slipped out of his armpit. So,
under cover of the tackle, because of some crazy notion,
I jerked it away from him. I violated a rule. I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>Coach Leland opened wide his blue eyes, but he
said nothing then. A little later, when he was by
Buck's side, he asked his question.</p>

<p>"Did you fumble when Bunny tackled you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I did," said the captain shortly; "it seems
to be a habit of mine." He kicked at a little clod of
dirt. "Hang it all, coach," he volunteered, "the&mdash;the
Scout was grandstanding for my benefit. He's
afraid of me."</p>

<p>The practice that day ended with drop-kicking.
Lining up the scrubs some thirty yards from the goal,
Leland gave Bunny the ball, with instructions to boot
it over the bar.</p>

<p>Bunny failed on five successive attempts. Twice
he fumbled good passes. Twice he caught the ball
with his toe too much on one side. Once he juggled
it wildly, allowing himself to be tackled before he
made the kick. And each time, as Buck noted with
wrinkled brow, opposing players were close enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to threaten any kicker who might have fear in his
heart.</p>

<p>When he made his fifth failure, Buck groaned.
With the post-season game for the State high-school
championship only two days away, his quarterback,
the very pivot of the team, was in a stage of cowardly
panic. He wished now that the game with Belden
had never been arranged; that they had been content
with a clean slate for the season; that they had agreed
to claim the title jointly with unbeaten Belden.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon came at last, with no change in
the situation. The two opposing teams lined up.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Belden?" asked the official.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Lakeville?"</p>

<p>Crouching just behind the line on which the new
football lay teed, Buck Claxton nodded his head.
The great crowd stilled expectantly. On the side
lines, blanketed and squatting like Indians, the substitutes
hunched forward their shoulders.</p>

<p>The official shrilled a blast on his whistle. Before
the echo had died, Bunny Payton's toe lifted the ball
from the ground and sent it hurtling high and far
toward the opposing eleven. The game was on.</p>

<p>As he ran, Buck sighed with relief. He had been
afraid of that first kick; afraid that Bunny's toe would
thug into the ground, or hit the ball askew, or roll it
feebly along the ribbed field.</p>

<p>But now, with the game actually begun, the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
kick-off gave Lakeville's captain hope. As Buck ran,
indeed, he let out his breath with an explosive gasp, and
the decisive way in which he downed the Belden fellow
who caught the ball was proof of his renewed confidence.
If Bunny Payton could only keep that yellow
streak under cover!</p>

<p>In the gruelling battle that followed, Buck was forced
to admit that Bunny shirked no duty. His end runs
were triumphs; his forward passes were pinnacles of
accuracy; his share in the interference were niceties of
skill and training. But always, as the tide of the game
flooded or ebbed, Buck shivered apprehensively over
possible situations that might reveal to their opponents
his quarterback's cowardice.</p>

<p>As they might have expected, Belden proved no mean
enemy. They could gain at times; once, indeed, they
might have pushed through the wavering Belden line
for a touchdown, except for a fumble. And that
fumble, as Buck recalled with grim pain, was his own.
Couldn't he ever learn to hold the ball once he had it?</p>

<p>But Belden gained, too. Like Lakeville, when they
couldn't advance the ball, they kicked. And so, for
three full quarters and part of another, neither team
was able to cross the other's goal line. Now, near the
end of the final period, the two teams fought in the
middle of the field. A scoreless tie seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>It was Lakeville's ball. As the players scrambled
into position for the scrimmage, Captain Claxton held
up his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much longer?" he shouted toward the side
lines.</p>

<p>"Four minutes to play," the timekeeper told him.</p>

<p>Buck groaned. They could never make it; they
could never carry the ball over those countless lines of
white to the goal beyond. True, they might go on
smashing forward a yard or two at a time, even making
their distances often enough to hold the ball, for Belden
was clearly tiring; but it would take longer than four
minutes to reach the last rib of the field. Buck felt
suddenly weak and limp. He would never make that
glorious touchdown of which he had dreamed each
night of the past week.</p>

<p>"Well, don't quit!" he snarled at his quarterback.</p>

<p>Bunny stepped into position. "Line up!" he yelled
shrilly. "Line up! Seven&mdash;four&mdash;six&mdash;two&mdash;ten!"</p>

<p>Buck's tired brain wrestled with the signal. It was
a new play they had learned that past week, a double
pass, with the quarterback eventually taking the ball.
Well, why not? Bunny was fast enough, and there
was no element of courage involved. Besides, in this
desperate eleventh hour, it was high time for trick
plays.</p>

<p>The ball was passed. As the Belden line braced
for the onslaught, Buck swung in behind Bunny, took
the soiled pigskin from him, ran with it toward the left
end, and then slipped it backward into the boy's eager
hands. The other team was jamming in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Lakeville captain, and he plunged head-down into the
mass, to carry on the deception. As he slipped and fell,
his ears caught the first rumble of a mighty cheer.
Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>He flung off the fellow who had piled upon him and
sprang to his feet. Down the field, almost in the
shadow of the goal posts, Bunny was just going down
under the tackle of the Belden man who played back.
The trick had succeeded. They were within striking
distance now. If Bunny had the nerve to try it again,
he might score.</p>

<p>Before Buck reached him, the quarterback was on
his feet again, dinning his eternal, "Line up! Line
up!" As the team rushed forward to obey, the boy
spat out his signal, "Nineteen&mdash;thirty&mdash;seven&mdash;four&mdash;six!"</p>

<p>What play was that? A cold wave of horror enveloped
Buck. His numbed mind told him nothing.
It was surely not a repetition of the trick they had just
tried. He might have known it would not be, he
thought contemptuously; this was a ticklish situation
calling for every ounce of nerve a player possessed.
Bunny would take mighty good care not to use himself
in the pinch. But what play was it?</p>

<p>"Signal?" the captain called.</p>

<p>Again the quarterback rattled off the numbers.</p>

<p>And then, abruptly, Buck's mind cleared. With only
a precious yard or two to go, the play must be a line
plunge, of course. Tricks were for long gains under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
desperate conditions. But why "seven&mdash;four&mdash;six"?
the captain asked himself in amazement. That
wasn't his signal; and it was only fair, only right, that
he, as the team's leader, should have the honor of the
touchdown.</p>

<p>"Signal?" he yelled angrily.</p>

<p>A third time it came. Buck knew the play now; it
was Barrett, right halfback, between tackle and guard.
So that was it! Another fellow was to carry the ball
over the line. Bunny was venting his petty spite by
refusing to allow his captain to make the attempt.</p>

<p>"Change signals!" Buck stormed.</p>

<p>In his position behind center, Bunny straightened a
little from his crouching position. "I'm taking the
responsibility for this play, Buck," he said evenly.
And then, like a flash, the signal rolled out once more,
the ball chugged into the quarterback's hands, and the
two teams were scrimmaging.</p>

<p>To his credit, be it said that Buck charged with the
others. The Belden line sagged, tautened, broke for
an instant. The players eddied and tossed, and were
sucked into the human whirlpool. Somewhere at the
bottom, Buck heard the long pipe of the official's
whistle. Then, as daylight reached him, he discerned
the smeared white goal line directly beneath him, and
on it&mdash;no, a good inch beyond!&mdash;the soiled yellow
ball. It was over. The touchdown had been made.</p>

<p>The balance of the game was like a vague dream.
Somebody kicked the goal and added another point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Somebody kicked off. The teams lined up once more
before a whistle ended the game. Lakeville was interscholastic
champion of the State.</p>

<p>Bunny slapped his captain on the back. "We beat
'em, Buck!" he yelled. "We beat 'em, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Buck Claxton distinctly, "we beat them,
you little sneak!"</p>

<p>The team cheered Belden then; and Belden came
back with a pretty poor apology of the formula that
runs, "What's the matter with Lakeville? They're
all right!" And then Belden, sad, defeated, yearning
for seclusion, shucked out of its football suits and into
street clothes, and went away from there just as fast
as it could.</p>

<p>Before the game, the Scouts had invited the Lakeville
squad to the Black Eagle Patrol clubhouse for supper.
When the invitation had been extended, Buck, Barrett,
Sheffield and Co. had looked blank, neither accepting
nor declining. But at six o'clock they were there, appearing
awkward and embarrassed, but altogether too
happy over the result of the game to bear any resentment.
That is to say, all of them looked that way except
Buck, who stared straight ahead during the meal,
and wouldn't talk, and didn't appear to be listening to
the jokes and jests that were bandied back and forth.</p>

<p>But when the meal was done, and Bunny, as toastmaster,
with clenched hands under the table, where
nobody could see them, and a forced smile on his face,
which everybody could see, rose and said easily, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
guess we'd all like to hear from the captain," Buck met
the issue squarely.</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a speech maker," he began slowly
(and rapidly proved that the literary and debating society
had taught him to be a very good one, indeed),
"but there's something that must be said, and I'm going
to ask you fellows to listen while I say it. This
last week has been a hard one for all of us, I guess,
but I think the one who's felt the hurts most is Quarterback
Bunny Payton."</p>

<p>They all looked at Bunny, of course, and the boy felt
his face go white. What was the captain of the football
team going to say about him?</p>

<p>"Back a while," Buck went on doggedly, "I thought
Bunny was no good. I guess a lot of you saw what
happened during practice&mdash;you know, when I was sore
at him, and he tackled me and got hold of the ball, and
then wouldn't make a touchdown because he thought
he had committed a foul. He was&mdash;was in pretty
bad, because it looked as if he had a streak of yellow
and was afraid of&mdash;well&mdash;me. I thought so. But
I was&mdash;was way off. It was just plain nerve that
made him stop when he had the ball.</p>

<p>"And about those goals he didn't kick. You know
what I mean. It sorta cinched what I thought about
him&mdash;a coward, I mean. But that wasn't right,
either. He had gashed his hand on a rock; that's why
he fumbled and juggled the ball and dropped it crooked
on his toe and&mdash;and everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then in the game to-day, he played like a trooper;
topnotch all the way through. You know what I mean&mdash;that
trick play that put the ball right on top of the
goal and&mdash;and everything.</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to make the touchdown then. Jiggers,
how I wanted to do it! But he wouldn't let me,
and I was sore at him all over again. You know what
I mean&mdash;how I felt, captain and everything, and he
wouldn't give me the ball. But I've been thinking
that over, and I hand it to him for his nerve again. He
gave Barrett the ball, and Barrett went over with it.
Say, that riled me. Why didn't he let me do it? But&mdash;well,
I've figured that out now. Barrett's a good
old sobersides hoss; you can always count on old Barrett.
And me&mdash;no. I fumbled once before in the
game; I guess maybe I'd 'a' fumbled again, and tossed
away the chance to win. Maybe. You know what I
mean. So he passes me up for Barrett. Talk about
nerve! Why, that took more courage, I'll bet, than
anybody else here ever thought of having; about a
million times more. But he did it. He knew the sure
way to win that game. Understand?</p>

<p>"Well, now listen to me. Maybe I won't go to
Lakeville High next year. So we ought to elect a captain
who will&mdash;sure. You know what I mean. And&mdash;well,
say, how about Bunny Payton for the job?"</p>

<p>It seemed to the little quarterback that the fellows
had gone suddenly insane. Before his dazed mind
could fully grasp Buck's suggestion, he had been unanimously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
elected captain, and Buck was congratulating
him, and the party was breaking up.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," he stammered to Buck, "we need you
for next year. Are you sure you won't be in school?"</p>

<p>"Well," drawled the ex-captain, winking prodigiously,
"I may die before then, or&mdash;or make a million
dollars and build me a school of my own, or&mdash;or something
like that. Anyhow, you'll be a better fellow for
the job than I ever was. You should have been leading
the team this year."</p>

<p>That was all, except that at the door Buck drew
Bunny aside.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "I'm just beginning to
realize that you Scouts are the real goods. You're
fine fellows, and you're fine athletes." He looked
warily over his shoulder. "It strikes me I'd like to be
a Scout myself, if they ever get up another patrol in
this little old town of ours."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE ICY HILL</p>

<p class="pn p2">Two days before Thanksgiving, it began snowing in
the late afternoon, going about the business of carpeting
the earth in white with such stubborn determination
that weatherwise folk were surprised when the following
morning marked the end of the storm. The sun peeped
forth; the snow packed into a soggy, slushy mass, only
to freeze that night under the grip of a bitter wind from
the northland. As a result, Thanksgiving was ushered
in to the merry jingle of sleigh bells, with cutters crisping
their way over the icy surfaces of the roads.</p>

<p>Breakfast over and chores done, Bonfire Cree strolled
forth that morning to take a look at the new winter
world. He was whistling cheerfully, like a true Boy
Scout, and he was keeping his eyes alert for some opportunity
to do a good turn before the day emerged
from its swaddling clothes.</p>

<p>His chance came at the top of "Old Forty Five
Hill", where a group of what Bonfire decided must be
the littlest and the most shopworn boys in town were
staring forlornly at the broken runner of a bobsled.
Their ages ranged from perhaps eight to eleven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
they were clad in a collection of last year's mufflers,
sweaters and overcoats that would have made a ragman
frown.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Raggedy Tatters!" Bonfire greeted a
youngster who appeared to be the leader. "How did
you break your sled?"</p>

<p>"I didn't break it. Petey Flack did; he coasted
over a rock. And my name isn't Raggedy Tatters,
either; it's Jimmie White."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Bonfire. "Glad to know you,
Jimmie White. Let's take a look at that sled." He
turned it over and ran a practiced eye over the runner.
"H'm! Can't patch that without iron braces, and the
blacksmith shop is closed to-day. 'Fraid you'll have to
call off this coasting party till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Aw, the snow'll melt by then," objected the
youngster. He dug the toe of his torn shoe into a little
drift and kicked disconsolately. "Let's nail on a
brace and try it."</p>

<p>"Your grandchildren will always be sorry if you try
that," Bonfire told him gravely. And then, somehow,
his mood changed; he began to understand the disappointment
of the little boys, and to sympathize with
them, and to search his mind for ways to help. "Look
here, Jimmie White," he said abruptly, "know where
the Scouts' clubhouse is?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"Well, you take this key, trot over there, unlock the
door, and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;and what?"</p>

<p>"And bring back the long bobsled you'll find inside.
Here," he called, as Jimmie grabbed the key and sped
away, "don't forget to lock the door again."</p>

<p>"No," flung the boy over his shoulder; and, as if
that were inadequate to such a benefactor, "No, sir,
I won't, Mister."</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Cree?" asked a voice behind him.</p>

<p>Bonfire turned quickly. In the seat of a sleigh that
had driven up sat Peter Barrett, while the head of a
little chap of five or six, too like Peter's to belong to
anybody but his little brother, barely showed above the
snug fur lap-robe.</p>

<p>"Morning, Barrett!" Bonfire called. "Oh, I'm
just going to take my friends coasting."</p>

<p>"Your friends?" repeated Peter Barrett, studying
the group of little boys.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Bonfire easily. "Aren't you my
friends, fellows?"</p>

<p>They were. They said so emphatically and loudly.</p>

<p>"You see," grinned Bonfire. "Oh, I'm just getting
acquainted with them, if that's what you mean. But
we're going to like each other. Their sled's busted;
so I sent Jimmie White over to the clubhouse for the
Scouts' bob. We went over that last night; put in a
new slat, sand-papered the runners, and so forth.
Want to go down the hill with us, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind," admitted the farmer boy. He tied
his horse to a tree and tucked the fur cover more snugly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
about his little brother. "Say, I&mdash;I'd like to steer
once, if you'll let me."</p>

<p>"Come ahead!"</p>

<p>By this time Jimmie White had arrived with the
bobsled. Almost before it had been straightened for
the start, the youngsters were scrambling aboard, with
Peter Barrett in front, Bonfire just behind him, and the
others piled on hit-and-miss to the very last inch of
the broad plank.</p>

<p>A second later, after some left-over boy had given
them a push, the big sled was coasting over the icy
trail, gathering speed with every foot. The hill had
been nicknamed "Old Forty Five" because of its
steepness; so sheer was the drop of the road in places
that the suggestion of an angle of forty-five degrees
was not altogether ridiculous. It seemed even steeper
to Bonfire. He sucked in his breath gaspingly.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared," Peter Barrett flung back over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm not scared," protested Bonfire, but he knew his
voice was far from convincing.</p>

<p>Near the foot of the long hill, a railroad track cut
across the trail. Bonfire was peering at it over the
steerer's right shoulder when the bob veered sharply to
the left. In spite of himself, the Scout grunted audibly.
A moment later, when the long sled straightened out
again, swishing along a road parallel to the track, he
would have given anything in the world to have recalled
that sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>They ground to a full stop. Bonfire piled off with
the others, pretending not to see Peter Barrett's superior
grin.</p>

<p>"I think it would be best," he offered, "to take that
turn with a long sweep."</p>

<p>"And sink the runners into the soft snow at the
side?" asked Barrett scornfully. "Why, that would
slow the sled to a walk, and it wouldn't run more than
fifty feet farther. I know how to steer, and I am willing
to take a chance. You Scouts&mdash;" But he thought
better of it, and left the accusation unsaid.</p>

<p>During the long climb up the hill, Bonfire was silent.
But at the top, when the bobsled had been turned for the
next trip, he took the forward position.</p>

<p>"Sure you can manage it?" asked Barrett. "Can
you make the turn this side of the railroad track, where
the road branches?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Because, if you can't, you'd better let me steer
again. You see, the other branch goes straight ahead
over the track and then around a corner with a big drop
to the creek on the outside edge. It's dangerous."</p>

<p>"I can turn this side of the track," said Bonfire
doggedly.</p>

<p>"All right," decided Barrett. "I'm ready."</p>

<p>So, it seemed, were the raggedy-taggedy youngsters.
Bonfire braced his feet on the crossbar and gripped the
steering lines. Another left-over boy, not the same one
this time, pushed them off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Clear!" he shouted the warning down the road
after them. "Clear for coasters!"</p>

<p>Halfway down the slide, round the first bend, the
long bobsled spun into a straightaway that was partially
blocked. A heavy wagon on runners seemed to occupy
the entire road. Bonfire saw it instantly. There was
a chance&mdash;just a bare, scant chance&mdash;that he might
steer by on the right, grazing the ponderous wagon.
But there would be only a foot or two to spare, and at
the terrific speed they were traveling a collision might
mean serious accident.</p>

<p>His quick eye told him something else, too. On
either side of the road, the snow was banked high in
great cushions. He made his decision instantly. Jerking
desperately on one line, he steered the bob off its
course and into the drift, turning it completely over
and spilling its human load into the soft mattress of
snow.</p>

<p>Nobody was hurt in the least. The little fellows
picked themselves up, righted the long sled, and
dragged it back into the road. Two or three of them
stared solemnly at Bonfire, but only Jimmie White
ventured any comment.</p>

<p>"A good steerer could have slipped past that wagon,
I guess," he said slowly. "Your&mdash;friend here could."</p>

<p>Bonfire shut his lips tightly. What was the use?
Perhaps, after all, he had been too cautious. It didn't
matter much now, one way or the other, for he knew
very well what Peter Barrett was thinking of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>They dragged the bobsled to the top of the hill again.
At the very crest, while they were stooping to turn it
about, little Jimmie White uttered a sudden cry. As
the others whirled, startled, Jimmie pointed a trembling
finger down the hill. Ten yards away, gaining momentum
as the first runway of the trail fell sharply downward,
was a single sled. Upon it lay a tiny figure.
Too small to know anything about steering, the child
was simply allowing the sled to carry him along in the
groove worn by the coasters.</p>

<p>For a long moment, the little group stared in stunned
bewilderment. Then, all at once, three of them spoke.</p>

<p>"He'll go across the railroad track to the turn of the
creek," said Bonfire, with queer huskiness, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and tumble into the creek," wailed little Jimmie
White. "The rocks there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Catch him!" shouted Peter Barrett. "Catch him!
Stop him! It&mdash;Cree, it's my kid brother!"</p>

<p>It was too late to whirl the bob about and begin the
chase with that. Two of the youngsters were tugging
at it, but precious seconds were being lost. There was
just one thing to do, and the three who had spoken
seemed to recognize it the same instant.</p>

<p>Each grabbed a light, single sled from its dazed
owner. Each lifted it clear from the icy trail, ran for
perhaps twenty feet, and then flung himself and sled
headlong upon the slide.</p>

<p>Luckily, the road was wide. The three sleds, already
racing dizzily from the running start, sped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
along side by side, with Peter Barrett's on the right,
little Jimmie White's in the middle, and Bonfire Cree's
on the left. Far ahead now&mdash;hopelessly far, it seemed
to Bonfire&mdash;the runaway, with its precious human
cargo, jounced and jolted its way down Old Forty Five.</p>

<p>Weight told at the outset. In the first hundred
yards, little Jimmie White dropped slowly behind the
other two, despite his frantic efforts to keep up. This
left only Peter Barrett and Bonfire actively in the chase,
and they raced along as if some invisible link yoked
them together.</p>

<p>At the first bend, Barrett swung a little wide. Bonfire
took the turn at a sharp angle, shutting his eyes for
a moment as his sled ran on one runner, and leaning
inward till half his body was over the side. It seemed
to him the sled would never right itself again. But it
did. With a welcome clank, the soaring iron came back
to the surface. When they straightened out once more,
beyond the turn, he was a full length ahead.</p>

<p>The memory of the wagon that had blocked the bob
made him shudder. Suppose another should be on the
road! But when he saw that it was clear, with only
the black dot of the runaway sled blotting its white
surface, he drew in a long breath of thanks and relief.
He could forget the danger of a possible collision now;
he could give to his mad coast every shred of his skill.</p>

<p>He flattened himself low on the sled; that would
lessen the wind friction. He steered almost wholly
by swaying his body; to shift the course by digging a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
toe into the trail would mean a tiny loss of speed.
He swerved around cloying drifts of snow, he avoided
holding ruts, he picked the icy sweeps of the road. As
the sled answered to each trick of jockeying, he wondered
grimly what Peter Barrett thought of his coasting
ability now. He might be too cautious, perhaps, when
recklessness meant danger to others, but Peter could
never again sneer at the way he steered.</p>

<p>But even with all these aids, he gained slowly on the
sled ahead. He had hoped to catch it halfway down
the hill. But as he whizzed past the rock that marked
this point, he was still far behind. Well, there was still
a long stretch before the runaway reached the railroad
track. He might catch it yet; might&mdash;no, must!</p>

<p>Under him, the runners rasped and sang. Tiny
particles of ice and snow pelted, sleet-wise, in his face.
Rocks and bumps in the road seemed to leer at him.
They hid from sight till he was fairly upon them; then
tried to upset his sled. Once, in steering about a particularly
dangerous clod, he barely skimmed it; and it
tore the mitten half from his hand, and knocked the
skin from his knuckle. The hurt bled a little, but his
fingers did not relax.</p>

<p>He was going like the wind now. The distance between
pursued and pursuer was being eaten up in great
bounds. If only he had a little more time! If only
the railroad track, with its fatal turn beyond, were a
little farther away!</p>

<p>Mingled with the <i>scratch-scratch</i> of the iron-shod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
runners came another sound,&mdash;loud, long, mournful.
He wondered vaguely what it was. Perhaps Peter's
sled behind was sending out that doleful wail. Then,
like a flash, came the explanation.</p>

<p>It was the whistle of an engine. A train was coming
over the railroad track. If the child on the sled crashed
into it&mdash;</p>

<p>In a frenzy of alarm, Bonfire lifted the forepart of
his sled from the surface. It skewed and tipped. One
runner creaked ominously. Forcing himself to think
only of the business of steering, he flung it back on the
trail, till the runners pointed dead ahead once more.</p>

<p>He could see the railroad now. A scant half-mile away
a heavy freight train was ploughing forward toward the
intersection of trail and track. And as nearly as he
could calculate, runaway sled and engine would reach it
together.</p>

<p>"I must catch it before it gets to the track!" he told
himself. "I must!"</p>

<p>The ice-drive filled his mouth as he spoke, half choking
him. Already his eyes were encrusted with a film
of frozen sleet, and objects ahead were blurring into an
indistinct white mass. For the first time, too, he began
to realize the doubt that he might reach the child in
time. A cowardly desire to swerve into the snow-bank
at one side, as he had done with the bob, fought for a
place in his mind. He knew now that he could never
pull up even before they reached the railroad track.</p>

<p>But he fought back the temptation. "'A Scout,'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
he told himself, "'is brave. A Scout is brave. A
Scout is brave.'"</p>

<p>Another sound dinned into his ears. It swept back
from the frozen trail ahead of him, and presently he
came to know that it was the frightened cry of the child
on the other sled. So near it sounded that he could
not believe the distance between them was more than
the reach of his arm. But it was. When he lifted his
head, he saw that a full ten feet still separated them.</p>

<p>The sled ahead was already taking the slight rise to
the railroad track. It would clear the onrushing engine
by a few precious feet. But in another second or two,
the path of the coasting slide would be effectually
blocked by the train. This child would cross in time;
he himself had no such margin of safety. In all
probability, he would strike the very prong of the cow-catcher.</p>

<p>"Too late!" he moaned. "I can't do it!" Then,
abruptly, his mind jerked back to what lay beyond: to
the turn they had told him about, and the creek below,
and the rocks. Resolutely, he held his sled to the
course.</p>

<p>As he swept upon the upgrade to the track, he heard
from behind Peter Barrett's shout.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't!</i>" it rang out. "Don't try it! You can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The whole world seemed to roar at him. There was
the clang of a bell, the hoarse whistle of the engine, the
hiss of steam, the rasp of brakes hard-set. To his left,
bearing down upon him, was a great monster of iron
and steel, with a sharp-pointed triangle skimming low
to destroy him.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He shut his eyes. Beneath him, the sled snapped
angrily over a steel rail. He was upon the railroad
track. He waited for the second click of the far rail&mdash;waited&mdash;waited&mdash;waited.
Would it never come?
Then&mdash;<i>snap!</i>&mdash;he felt it. A flurry of wind sucked
behind him. A shadow darkened the white snow.
With a scream, as of terror, the monster of iron crossed
the trail a second after he had cleared the track. He
was over safely.</p>

<p>A little decline slanted from the railroad. At its
very foot was some obstacle; and he jerked his sled to
one side, angry over the forced loss of speed. The big
rock, or whatever it was, appeared to be calling to
him. He jerked his head savagely to clear his eyes,
wondering dully why he did not pass it. Then he
laughed hysterically. It was the sled with Peter Barrett's
little brother, running over the icy road at his very
side.</p>

<p>He swerved toward it, reached out a shaking hand,
and closed his fingers upon the flare of the runner.
The two sleds were one now.</p>

<p>The dangerous turn was just beyond. It led to the
left, and he dug his left toe savagely into the trail,
holding it there like a brake, till the double-sled pivoted
to its friction and swung where the road led. But
there was no room to spare. Before they were around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
they had climbed the bank overhanging the creek, balanced
perilously a moment on its brink, and dashed
back to the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Afterward&mdash;some minutes afterward&mdash;when the
locked sleds had ground to a standstill, and the train
had passed, and Peter Barrett and little Jimmie White
had come coasting gingerly and frightenedly to the
foot of Old Forty Five, they found Bonfire sitting
weakly on the snowy ground, with one arm about the
child. The latter was talking happily, but Bonfire
was too exhausted to speak.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it," said little Jimmie
White. There was honest hero-worship in his eyes.
"No, never!"</p>

<p>It was harder for Peter Barrett. "I&mdash;I did a lot
of thinking back there," he began awkwardly, "trailing
you down Old Forty Five. I&mdash;I guess I've been
blind, Rodman, when I looked at you Scouts. I
thought you were&mdash;well, stuck on yourselves, and too
good for poorer people. But this morning&mdash;" He
waved a comprehensive hand toward the top of the
hill, where the ragged little band of boys had been left
behind, and did not complete the sentence. "When
that train cut me off&mdash;Do you know, I think you
Scouts have the right idea of things, mostly. I&mdash;Well,
it&mdash;it's Thanksgiving." He winked his eyes
rapidly as they turned toward his little brother.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter," said Bonfire understandingly, "it's
Thanksgiving."</p>

<p>"Spite-work, I tell you!" chimed in Specs. "You
know who picked the players as well as I do, with
Professor Leland home sick in bed. Sheffield did.
He's captain of the team, president of the athletic
association, and&mdash;and enemy of the Boy Scouts, isn't
he? Well!"</p>

<p>"Sheffield's all right himself," Bi admitted slowly,
"but"&mdash;he looked up defiantly&mdash;"but the others
aren't any better than we Scouts who have been playing."</p>

<p>"We were on the regular team when we beat Elkana
that first game, I guess!" blazed Jump. "It
was the other way around then, with Kiproy, Barrett,
Collins and Turner as the substitutes. Right after
that, Sheffield began to sack us, one at a time. There
were three Scouts on the team that beat Grant
City, then two in the Charles City mix-up, and
finally only Bunny against Deerfield. Now there
isn't a single one of us on the regular five.
It's a wonder we are still in the running for the
pennant."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't be," prophesied S. S.; "not after
this Elkana game. You just wait and see!"</p>

<p>"They certainly buried us the last time," said Bunny,
making a wry face. "But so did Grant, and you all
know we nosed them out in the rubber. I wonder&mdash;Bonfire,
what's wrong? What does this new line-up
mean, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Number 8 of the Black Eagle Patrol stopped tapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the table with his pencil and looked up. "Want
the truth?" he asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>There was a sheeplike nodding of heads. One and
all, the Scouts had been won to the uncanny results
of Bonfire's powers of observation.</p>

<p>"Well," began the tenderfoot slowly, "I have an
idea Sheffield is trying to face Elkana with the strongest
team he can put together; he'll have to if he expects
to win, because Elkana has easily the best team,
with the possible exception of our own, in the high-school
league. I don't think he has dropped you Scouts
because of spite."</p>

<p>Bi bristled. "You mean that those other four are
better players than we are?"</p>

<p>"No." Bonfire considered the case judicially.
"No, you fellows are better than they are&mdash;individually."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Bi. I think I can make you understand
what I mean. Basketball, you see, isn't like
football, where the quarter calls a signal that tells some
player what to do; nor like baseball, where you field
a certain position, or bat yourself on base, or try to
bring another fellow home. No, basketball is different,
a lot different. When the ball comes to you,
maybe you dribble it along and pass it to somebody
else, and maybe you try for a basket yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won the first Elkana game," Bonfire interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
placidly, "by pure luck. You lost the second
because you were outplayed at every turn. You'll
lose the third and deciding one, too, if Sheffield starts
the same team again, playing the same kind of game."</p>

<p>"But you just said we were better players than
Barrett and Kiproy and Collins and Turner."</p>

<p>Bonfire looked him squarely in the face. "Better
individually, I said. The trouble with you fellows is
that you are too good. You can shoot baskets so accurately
that you forget there is more to the game
than merely looping the ball for a goal every time you
get hold of it. Look here, Bunny, who shot the most
baskets in the game we won from Elkana?"</p>

<p>"Sheffield," the patrol leader admitted readily.</p>

<p>"And in the Grant game? And the Deerfield
game?"</p>

<p>"Sheffield. We aren't claiming, though, that he
isn't the best basketball player in Lakeville. He is, I
guess. But in those last games, at least, he had more
chances to score than any other player."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Bonfire. "And that is how Lakeville
will beat Elkana Saturday&mdash;if it does. By
teamwork, by each player's forgetting himself for the
good of the machine, by feeding the ball at every opportunity
to the best basket-shooter of them all&mdash;Royal
Sheffield. Kiproy won't try to score, but to pass the
ball to Sheffield whenever he can, and then hover under
the basket for a possible miss; and so will Collins and
Barrett and Turner. You four fellows might loop it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in from the center of the floor, or from off to one side&mdash;sometimes!
Sheffield won't miss one try out of
five. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>It was obvious that they did. There was a solemn
nodding of heads. Curiously enough, slow-thinking Bi
was the one to voice the thought that was taking root in
the mind of each of them.</p>

<p>"But why," he asked, "didn't Sheffield explain his
system to Bunny and S. S. and Jump and me, and have
us feed the ball to him in the game?"</p>

<p>Bonfire answered with another question. "Why
did you fellows think he had dropped you from the
team for spite?" He waited a moment for the idea
to grip. "Don't you see, Bi, that just as surely as
you have been mistrusting him, just that surely he
has been questioning your willingness to do him a good
turn without hope of reward? The others are so glad
to make the team that they will play as he says."</p>

<p>"But we would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, you would," Bonfire caught him up.
"But Sheffield doesn't know that your good turns are
not done for pay, even in applause. He doesn't know
that when a Boy Scout does a good turn, he doesn't
wait around for thanks; doesn't even tell anybody else
he has done a good turn. I am sorry he can't understand,
because I know that if you fellows only had
the chance, you'd play up to him as those others never
will. But&mdash;Well, let's keep that eighth law in mind;
let's be cheerful and obey orders." He glanced apologetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
toward Bunny. "I didn't mean to preach,"
he added, smiling.</p>

<p>Bunny smiled back understandingly. At that moment,
he was thinking not only that Bonfire was a
mighty good Boy Scout, but that he would make an
equally satisfactory patrol leader. If the Black Eagles
ever needed a new Number 1&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Going to the game?" Specs asked Bonfire
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o. I'd like to, but I can't afford to spend
the money."</p>

<p>Bonfire did not mention the ninth law, about thrift,
but Bunny knew the boy had it in mind. "Yes, sir,"
he told himself, "he'd make a dandy patrol leader.
Wish he was going to Elkana with us; he helps win
more games than any player."</p>

<p>If Bunny had known of the problem he was to face
at seven-thirty the next Saturday evening, between
halves, he would have put that wish in stronger words;
for he was to need Bonfire's advice and help more than
ever before.</p>

<p>At two-ten on the afternoon of the fateful day, the
manager of the Elkana Athletic Association met them
as they stepped from the train.</p>

<p>"Good news!" he greeted. "We have arranged
to play the game this evening in the Hallworth College
gymnasium. Come on; I'll take you right over."</p>

<p>And a little later:</p>

<p>"This is the dressing room. You can put your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
clothes in this big locker while you play. Yonder are
the shower baths. Now, if you like, you can use the
main floor upstairs to practice till three-thirty; sort
of give you the feel of the place, anyhow. Well,
good-by and good luck to-night&mdash;only not too much
of that last!"</p>

<p>Captain Sheffield elected to take advantage of the
invitation to put his five through a short, brisk practice.
Ten minutes proved ample, not only to satisfy
him that the team was on edge, but to bathe it in perspiration.</p>

<p>"Call it a day!" said Sheffield at last. "Now get
your baths and meet me here about six, to go out to
supper together."</p>

<p>Bunny noticed that he left them free to do as they
pleased the balance of the afternoon. It worried him
a little. If he had been captain of the team, he would
have warned the boys, at least, to loaf and rest as much
as possible, that they might be fresh for the game.
But, after all, Sheffield was in charge, not he; and
Bunny knew Royal well enough to realize that youth's
contempt for "tying anybody to his apron strings",
as he had once put it.</p>

<p>But the tiny unrest would not down. Ten minutes
later, his body glowing pink after a shower and a brisk
rub with a great Turkish towel, Jump fed new fuel to
the worry.</p>

<p>"Bunny," he said carelessly, "you don't mind if we
go swimming, do you? There's a big tank in there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
with the water so clear you can see the bottom all
over."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Jump," the patrol leader decided, "but it
wouldn't do. You'd tire yourself out in no time."</p>

<p>"The other fellows are swimming right now," Jump
protested.</p>

<p>Bunny clenched his hands. "The Scouts, you
mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Kiproy and Collins and Turner and Barrett.
Bi said we ought to get your permission before we
went in."</p>

<p>"Not now," Bunny told him. "After the game,
maybe, but not now." He watched Jump slouch dejectedly
away. "I wish," he told himself, "that
Sheffield had stayed around and told those others not
to go swimming. It won't help their speed any in the
basketball game."</p>

<p>But at supper that evening, when they were guests
of the Elkana team, the four boys who had been in
the tank looked so fresh and fit for battle that Bunny
decided no harm had been done. The business of eating
a delicious meal, and of getting acquainted with
their opponents, and of bandying challenges and promises
and good-natured threats back and forth apparently
galloped the hands of the clock on the wall; and
it seemed no time at all before they were piling upstairs
from the gymnasium dressing quarters into a
room flooded with brilliant light and banked on all
sides by a large and noisy gathering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Some official tossed a coin for choice of baskets, and
Sheffield said "Heads." He laughed when he won.</p>

<p>"I don't see any advantage either way," he told the
Elkana captain. "Pick your side, please."</p>

<p>From the substitutes' bench, Bunny nodded his appreciation
of this fine sportsmanship. After all,
Sheffield had his good points. He watched eagerly as
the Lakeville captain and a tall, rangy Elkana boy
faced each other in the middle of the floor. Then the
referee tossed the ball high into the air between them,
piped a shrill blast on his whistle as it reached its top
limit, and the game was on.</p>

<p>What followed was so rapid that Bunny could hardly
follow the play. Sheffield leaped and whacked the ball
to the right, straight for the side. But Turner was
there to make the catch. He dribbled it, dodged a
rushing opponent, dribbled it another yard, and suddenly
shot it, with a long underhand pass, across the
floor to Collins, far on the left. Like ants, the players
swarmed toward him; the whole playing court, indeed,
was curiously like an ant hill. Collins bounced the ball
just once before he shot it to Barrett, on the opposite
side. Barrett spun it through an open space to Kiproy,
who was in a corner of the great quadrangle. By this
time, Sheffield had raced down the center to a spot just
in front of the basket. Here he took a perfect throw,
balanced the ball in his hands, and then looped it upward
for the net, scoring the first two points of the
game in exactly twenty-seven seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, boy!" gasped Jump on the bench, "I guess
that's teamwork." And the other three Lakeville substitutes
agreed that it certainly was.</p>

<p>But one basket in the first half-minute does not
spell victory. Even before Lakeville had scored again,
by an intricate triangular shooting combination that
evolved a forward crisscross, Bunny fancied he could
detect a laggard movement here and there; not enough,
in any one instance, to interfere with rapid and accurate
passing, but still a hint of possible future trouble.</p>

<p>After that, while Elkana was looping its first basket
and Lakeville countering with its third, Bunny saw
more and more clearly that only Sheffield was maintaining
the dashing pace the team had set in the beginning.
Barrett was puffing hard and running with a slight
effort; Collins and Turner were slowing perceptibly;
Kiproy was making passes an instant before they were
necessary. In another five minutes of hard play, with
the ball rushed from one end of the court to the other
a dozen times, the lessening of snap and rush on Lakeville's
part was becoming hideously apparent. Elkana
had scored twice more, making the count six all.</p>

<p>Bunny knew the turn of the tide was at hand. The
Elkana cheerers knew it, too, and yelled and tooted
horns and rang bells and swung into a mighty rhythmical
roar of, "One, two, will do!" It was a silly thing,
Bunny thought; but it wasn't half as bad as the tag
of, "Three, four, five, six; all scored on tricks!" when
the goals reached that figure; nor the jubilant, "Seven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
eight; just you wait!" when the Elkana team added
another basket. Lakeville's total was still six.</p>

<p>With the first half nearly over, the visiting team was
playing with its back against the wall, strictly on the
defensive. Sheffield was still alert and dangerous, but
he could not shoot goals when the other players failed
to feed him the ball. A dozen times, it seemed to
Bunny, the captain broke up threatening formations of
Elkana's almost single-handed; and once, just at the
end, he shot a clean basket from near the center of
the floor, looping the ball upward in a great arc and
dropping it like a plummet within the iron ring that
supported the net. But Elkana scored again, too;
and when the pistol shot signaled the end of the half,
the blackboard showed: Lakeville, 8; Elkana, 10.</p>

<p>It meant defeat, Bunny knew, inglorious defeat.
Lakeville was slowing and weakening; Elkana was only
warming to the final onslaught. In a way, too, his
conscience told him, the fault was his; he might have
gone straight to the tank that afternoon and begged
the fellows to come out before they tired themselves.
He wished now that he had.</p>

<p>Between halves, while the four exhausted players lay
stretched on benches, Sheffield wandered down the aisle
between the rows of lockers for a glass of water.
Bunny took quick advantage of his absence.</p>

<p>"Bring a drink of water for each of them, won't
you?" he said querulously to the three substitutes. He
waited till they were out of earshot. "Look here, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
fellows!" he began grimly, spreading his legs and
leaning toward them in his earnestness. "You're
ready to drop, every last one of you, because of that
long swim this afternoon. Does Sheffield know about
it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't mention it to him," said Kiproy carelessly.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Somebody should!" snapped Bunny. "Not one
of you is fit to play another minute, and he ought to
know the reason."</p>

<p>Collins sat up. "Are you going to snitch?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I'm no tattletale. But I'm going
to ask you not to start this next half."</p>

<p>"So the substitutes can go in, eh?" It was Turner's
slur.</p>

<p>"Maybe they can't hold that Elkana five," flashed
Bunny, "but they're fresh, anyhow, and not half dead.
Will you drop out, Kiproy?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't!"</p>

<p>"You, Collins? Turner? Barrett?"</p>

<p>In each case, the reply was a curt refusal. Barrett
added doubtfully, "We'll be in shape by the time
play starts again."</p>

<p>"After swimming in the tank for nearly an hour!"
Bunny cried scornfully. "You know better than that,
all of you. Once more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time's up! Come on!" It was Sheffield's cool
voice. The captain stood at the end of the long bench.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Bunny brought his feet together and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
straightened up. "I can't do a single thing," he told
himself bitterly. "I won't snitch, and I can't force
them to quit playing. We're beaten, that's all."</p>

<p>Up the winding stairway marched the five members
of the team; up and through the doorway at the top,
and out upon the main floor of the gymnasium, to
certain, inevitable defeat. On the bottom step, unconscious
that he was blocking the way for the other three
substitutes, Bunny watched till the last foot lifted and
disappeared.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE LAST GOAL</p>

<p class="pn p2">The second half began. A blast from the referee's
whistle sent the two teams scurrying to their positions.
Again Sheffield and the Elkana center faced each other
in the middle of the floor; again the official tossed the
ball high into the air; again he blew his warning signal
as it reached the top of its flight.</p>

<p>But here the repetition of the first play of the game
ended. As Sheffield raised his right arm for the tap,
his elbow jabbed against the breast of his opponent,
topping the boy off-balance. With a desperate effort,
the latter tried to straighten and swing for the falling
ball; but he was an instant too late. Sheffield whanged
it straight and hard into Kiproy's waiting arms.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Bunny, on the substitutes' bench.
It was like the cry from some hurt.</p>

<p>No shrill of the referee's whistle marked the foul.
Clearly, the official had been watching the flight of the
ball, rather than the two opposing players who had
leaped for it as it fell, and had thus failed to detect
any unfair interference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>But the spectators had seen. A little hiss of disapproval
grew to a buzzing growl, like a tiny breeze
that nods the daisies in a distant field and snarls
through the bushes as it comes close.</p>

<p>Kiproy bent to make a pass. Sheffield held up a
staying hand.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he called. In the tense silence that followed,
Bunny could hear him clearly. "I interfered
with that toss-up&mdash;unintentionally; jabbed the Elkana
center with my elbow. Call a foul, Referee!"</p>

<p>The noise broke anew, but it was the clapping of
hands this time, and the stamping of feet and little
shouts of approval, like a rollicking gale at play.
Bunny looked out at Sheffield, through what seemed
queerly like a fog, and said, "Oh, that's fine!" And
even when some Elkana fellow was given a free trial
for goal and netted a basket, he repeated, "Yes, that's
fine!" At that moment, he liked Sheffield more than
he ever had before.</p>

<p>Over at the blackboard, the boy rubbed out the ten
under Elkana's name and traced an eleven in its place.
Lakeville's total was still eight.</p>

<p>Sheffield outjumped the opposing center on the next
toss-up, which was free of any semblance of foul, and
whacked the ball to Barrett. Peter whirled completely
around, to throw off the guard hovering in front of
him, and started a dribble. But just as he was ready
to make the pass, some Elkana player stepped in and
captured the ball. It was not an unusual incident, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
it made Bunny squirm. Peter had been just the tick
of a watch too slow.</p>

<p>After that, things began steadily to go wrong. The
four players who had been in the tank started to
shrink when they should have charged, to submit
weakly to an opponent's making a pass when they
should have scrimmaged for a toss-up, to be always
the tiny fraction of a second too late in catching, shooting,
dodging. Elkana scored. It scored again. After
perhaps three minutes of play in the second half, the
figures on the blackboard read: Lakeville, 8; Elkana,
15.</p>

<p>"We're licked," Bunny muttered, digging his finger
tips into moist palms, "unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was like a cue for Sheffield's action. Before the
ball could be put into play again, the Lakeville captain
stepped to the referee's side and said something in a
quick, decisive manner. The man nodded. Then
Sheffield lifted a beckoning finger toward the substitutes'
bench.</p>

<p>Bunny looked at the other three, as if expecting one
of them to rise at the signal, and the other three looked
at Bunny the same way. None of them seemed to
know which substitute he wanted.</p>

<p>"Come on!" called Sheffield gruffly; then, after one
heart-breaking instant of hesitation, "All of you!"</p>

<p>At that, of course, they dropped the single blanket
they had thrown over their shoulders and scampered
out upon the floor. They tried to look unconcerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
during the little journey, but nobody was much deceived.
Barrett, Kiproy, Collins and Turner, walking
wearily and dejectedly toward the bench, passed them
without speaking.</p>

<p>There was no time for Sheffield to coach them in
the style of game he wanted them to play. Possibly,
too, he thought any instructions of his would be so
much wasted breath. All he could do was to hope for
the best, in a forlorn sort of way, and trust to their
natural ability to net a basket when the opportunity
offered. They knew the formations and the signals;
individually, he admitted, they were crack players.
Well&mdash;</p>

<p>Lakeville had practiced its deceptive forward crisscross
at least one hundred times. When Sheffield hit
the ball on the toss-up, he sent it directly across the
floor to S. S., playing left guard, on the double hope
that this unexpected maneuver would fool Elkana again
and that young Zane would be ready for the catch.</p>

<p>Never had Bob Collins played it better. With a deceptive
lunge, S. S. shook off the player hovering about
him, dashed forward, took the pass, dribbled the ball
till the very last safe moment, and then shot it across
to Bi, at right guard. From him it zigzagged back to
the opposite side, into Jump's waiting hands, and, with
just enough delay to pull in the baffled Elkana players,
on to Bunny, playing in one corner of the court, within
easy looping distance of the basket.</p>

<p>All this time, of course, Sheffield had been racing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
down the middle, till he was now squarely in front of
the goal, with only one negligent guard anywhere near
him. But Bunny was also clear for the moment.</p>

<p>"Shoot it!" shouted the captain, eyes already raised
to the basket for the try.</p>

<p>Bunny poised the ball in his hands. Sheffield's
guard shuffled toward the danger zone. But even as
he drew back his arms, Bunny whirled and made an
overhand pass to his captain. So unexpected was this
play, and so rapid the throw, that Sheffield came near
being taken unawares.</p>

<p>But he set himself in time. Hard and true came the
ball, zipping against his open palms, with every last
Elkana player temporarily paralyzed by surprise.
With something very like a smile, Sheffield balanced
himself, taking plenty of time, and nonchalantly looped
it upward for the gaping basket in front of him. It
was a perfect goal.</p>

<p>Score: Lakeville, 10; Elkana, 15.</p>

<p>"Nice work!" Sheffield grunted to Bunny.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure&mdash;yet. But a minute later, when
Jump, in the very shadow of the goal, lifted the ball
high above his head and then flicked it back to his captain,
six feet behind him, Sheffield knew for certain.
He made that basket, too, and he ran laughing for the
next toss-up, as if all the people in Elkana couldn't
stop his team now. The Scouts were doing just what
he had trained those others to do, just what he had declared
the Scouts would never agree to do. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
feeding him the ball; they were playing, not for the
applause and glory of shooting goals, but for the bigger
thing, for the team itself.</p>

<p>Score: Lakeville, 12; Elkana, 15.</p>

<p>Neither side scored during the next few minutes.
But that worried Bunny not one whit, and he guessed
Sheffield felt the same about it. For Lakeville had
come into her own at last, as if her five players were a
single body with ten arms and ten legs. They rushed
the ball toward their goal, tapping, tossing, dribbling,
shooting it from boy to boy, looping it for the basket,
scrambling after misses, and turning from offense
to defense when Elkana took possession of it and
began a march, with many side trips, in the other
direction.</p>

<p>Elkana had not fought victoriously throughout the
season without sound cause. Its team answered this
new challenge like thoroughbreds. Put upon their
mettle, the five players rose to a skill they had never
shown before, and swept down the floor to the climax
of another basket.</p>

<p>"Never mind that!" grinned Bunny, passing a
grimy hand over his streaked face. "We'll beat 'em
yet!"</p>

<p>"You bet we will!" Sheffield flashed back.</p>

<p>Hard on the heels of this stiffening determination,
Lakeville scored again, and yet again. Sheffield shot
both goals, but Bunny knew he was ready enough to
give credit to the machine behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Elkana led now by a single point. The score board
read: Lakeville, 16; Elkana, 17.</p>

<p>Sixty seconds later, in a most peculiar manner,
came the chance to tie the score. Lakeville had already
failed on a direct side-center pass formation and on a
single side cross-forward play that had counted in other
games. Wisely, Sheffield called for the forward crisscross
that had twice baffled Elkana.</p>

<p>It looked as if the play were to go through. Backward
and forward across the floor, the ball wove its
way, till it was time for the final pass to Sheffield, already
in a favorable position to shoot the basket. But
just at the last, an Elkana player sensed the trick.
With flying arms, like a Holland windmill adrift, he
swept down upon the Lakeville captain.</p>

<p>Sheffield dodged. So did the Elkana boy. Sheffield
dodged back again, to confuse his opponent. The
result was a semi-success. The other player had
guessed wrong, and what happened was as much a surprise
to one as the other.</p>

<p>With a crash, the two collided solidly. Sheffield fell
flat on his back, the Elkana boy piled on top of him,
and the referee's whistle shrilled.</p>

<p>"Foul for charging!" the official announced.
"Free trial for goal for Lakeville!"</p>

<p>Bunny Payton fairly wriggled with eagerness.
"Tie score if you make this goal!" he exulted, as
Sheffield clambered to his feet dabbing at his eye
with an open hand. "Not hurt, are you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Where's the ball? Everybody ready?"</p>

<p>Bracing himself, feet apart, directly behind the foul
line, Sheffield took the ball in both hands, raised it suddenly
in an overhand loop shot&mdash;and missed the
basket by a good six inches!</p>

<p>Nobody spoke. Nobody told him it didn't matter;
for it did, mightily. Nobody even asked what the
trouble was. But that wide miss, by a center who
could net a goal nine times out of ten on free throws,
was like a dash of cold water to the Lakeville team.</p>

<p>"But we won't quit," Bunny told himself, trotting
into position for the next toss-up. "He'll have another
chance in a minute."</p>

<p>It came even sooner than he expected. Scurrying
here and there over the floor, apparently without aim
or purpose, but in reality dodging and running with
preconceived plan, the Lakeville five edged closer and
closer to the basket, till in the end Sheffield caught a
long pass almost in front of the goal. With a quick
leap to one side, he shook off the Elkana guard; with
the precision born of much practice, he looped the ball
up and over.</p>

<p>The shot was long. Hitting the backboard a full
foot above the net, the ball bounced back against the
outer edge of the metal ring, hung uncertainly a moment,
and then trickled free to the floor. For the
second time in as many minutes, Sheffield had failed.</p>

<p>"Three minutes to play!" the timekeeper called, as
they raced back to their positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Three minutes! And Lakeville one point behind!
Bunny balled his nervous hands into hard fists and
tried to swallow the lump that kept coming up in his
throat. There was a chance yet, of course, but with
Sheffield shooting wildly&mdash;</p>

<p>For the third time in succession, a little later, the
Lakeville captain missed the basket. This throw was
the worst of the three; a blind man, Bunny told himself
bitterly, might have come as close. What was the
good of feeding Sheffield the ball, if he chucked away
his chances like that?</p>

<p>There couldn't be much more than a minute to play
now. When Sheffield lined up against the Elkana center
once more, he spat out a curt, "Everybody in it
this time," and jumped and batted the ball to S. S.
That <i>in</i> was the signal for the old forward crisscross.
Bunny shook his head doubtfully, but ran to his place.</p>

<p>The ball darted to and fro, like a swallow winging
for safety: from S. S. to Bi, from Bi to Jump, from
Jump to Bunny. Everybody was running and shouting,
quite as if each player had gone suddenly insane.
"Here you are!" somebody would call. "Shoot it!"
"Watch out!" "Careful!" "Plenty of time!"
"Plenty of time!" And then, having tantalized some
opposing rusher, "Come on!" "Shoot it!"</p>

<p>By now, Sheffield was down the floor, in front of
the basket and a little to the left. But Bunny was as
close on the other side and less carefully guarded.
Elkana, you see, had discovered that Lakeville's captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
was usually the final link between the last pass and the
try for goal. As a result, its players were beginning to
watch him like hawks.</p>

<p>"Shoot it!" yelled Sheffield, trying vainly to shake
off the Elkana guard.</p>

<p>Bunny bounced the ball long enough to give this
order time to register in his brain. "He means for
me to try for a basket," he decided happily. He tapped
the ball to the floor again. "And I can make it, too; I
know I can."</p>

<p>None of the Elkana players seemed to be worrying
about him in the least. Bunny dribbled the ball a little
nearer the goal, keeping a wary eye on Sheffield, who
was twisting and doubling and flopping about, like a&mdash;like
a chicken with its head off.</p>

<p>"That's just what he looks like," Bunny grinned
to himself. "Shucks! If I did pass him the ball,
he'd throw it wild. He's done it three times now."</p>

<p>"Shoot it!" ordered Sheffield, in a frenzy of excitement.
He ran back a few steps and threw up his
hands. Bunny wanted to think he was pointing toward
the goal, but some curious prick of his conscience suggested
that he might be motioning for a catch.</p>

<p>There was only a second or two to decide now.
Down in his heart, Bunny was sure&mdash;absolutely sure&mdash;that
he could make the goal. He could already see
himself holding the ball with both hands in front of
his chest, pushing it upward till his arms were straight
from shoulders to fingertips, and launching it, straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and true, upward and over and down, in a great looping
shot that would nestle it in the swaying net below the
iron hoop. He knew, just as certainly as he knew he
was standing there, that he could score that goal.</p>

<p>"And I don't think Sheffield can," he argued stubbornly.
"He&mdash;he's like a chicken with its head off."</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye, as he dribbled the ball,
he saw an Elkana boy sweeping toward him. It must
be now or never. With a quick lunge ahead, he diverted
the other's straight line of charge; then, stepping
backward abruptly, he found himself clear for
the moment. The ball bounded from the floor and
plumped upon the open palm of his right hand.</p>

<p>But something stayed the left hand from clapping
upon that side of the leather, preliminary to the try for
goal. Instead, turning a little, he swung his right arm
in a circle, shouted a warning to Sheffield, now temporarily
free of heckling guards, and shot the ball to him.</p>

<p>"It's playing the game," he said to himself in a half-whisper.
Just the same, it hurt, even more than he
cared to admit, to make that sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Lakeville captain seemed to catch the ball exactly
in position for looping it toward the basket.
In the twinkling of an eye, Sheffield had tossed it upward,
using the same overhand shot Bunny had partially
begun.</p>

<p>Up and up sped the ball, with ten open-mouthed
players following its course with twenty popping eyes;
up and up, till it seemed it would never stop, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
after a languid pause in mid-air, down and down, going
faster every instant, till it plopped squarely within
the metal rim of the basket and swished on into the
hanging net.</p>

<p>The goal was scored. Lakeville now led, 18-17.</p>

<p>In the midst of a scrimmage, directly after the next
toss-up, a sudden crack from the timekeeper's pistol
signaled the end of the game. Lakeville had won.
The road to the championship would be easy traveling
now.</p>

<p>Sheffield took his honors without any display of
emotion; he was that sort of winner. To the four
substitutes who had made possible the victory, he
merely said, "Good work, fellows!" But Bunny
guessed he meant a good deal more than the words expressed.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you try for that last basket yourself?"
he asked Bunny, as they piled downstairs to the dressing
room. "You could have scored."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I could," Bunny admitted honestly.
"I was afraid of you, too, after you had missed those
others, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something in my eye," explained Sheffield; "got
it in when I took that tumble. That's why those
shots went wild. But it was out before your last pass."</p>

<p>"I gave you the ball," Bunny went on doggedly,
"because I knew that was the kind of game you had
planned&mdash;feeding it to you and letting you shoot the
baskets. You didn't exactly tell us, of course, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
knew. And a Scout is supposed to be obedient to his
leader and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Sheffield, and let the matter drop.
"By the way, why didn't you fellows go swimming
with the rest this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how did you know about that?"</p>

<p>"Heard you talking to Barrett and Kiproy and Collins
and Turner just before I called them for the second
half. But I don't see why&mdash;Yes, I guess I do, too.
Your Scouts asked you if they could, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't let them, I suppose. Right!"
He turned to Bunny with a smile in his eyes. "Obedience
to the leader again, eh? Sort of apron strings.
H'm!"</p>

<p>Bunny couldn't make out whether Sheffield was
sneering or just turning the matter over in his mind.
But when he began a stumbling explanation, the captain
cut him short with a question.</p>

<p>"Would you Scouts object," he asked, "to being tied&mdash;well,
say loosely&mdash;to my apron strings in basketball?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because if you wouldn't mind accepting me as a
leader in the game," Sheffield went on evenly, "I have
an idea we might show those other high schools quite
a nifty little team."</p>

<p class="pb2">In view of the fact that Lakeville simply romped
through the balance of the schedule to the championship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it is to be supposed that the Scouts didn't object
to obeying the captain. In any event, after another
week of strenuous practice, the notice on the bulletin
board of the high school read:</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">AN ALARM OF FIRE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Palms propping his chin, elbows braced on knees,
Specs McGrew squatted on the family's front steps,
staring out at the street.</p>

<p>"I wish it was over," he grumbled. "Why don't
Roundy and Jump come? Say, Bunny, if I had a
five-dollar bill in my pocket, I'd give it to anybody
who could pick me up right out of this morning and
set me down somewhere to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Bunny laughed. "Oh, the game won't be as bad
as all that. Still, if you don't want to play, I guess we
can persuade S. S. to take your place at short."</p>

<p>"Huh?" Specs twisted his head round. "Let
S. S. play against Belden instead of me! Not if I
know it! Just the same, I wish it was over, and down
in your heart I bet you do, too."</p>

<p>The peace of a June morning hung over Lakeville, a
quiet that was even deeper than usual; for not only
was this the day when the Lakeville High baseball
team went to Belden to play the last game of the season,
but it was also the day of Dunkirk's great Home
Coming Picnic; and a long excursion train, crowded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the platforms, had left the village at 7:30. The town
was deserted. As Specs put it, "A cyclone or a fire
could walk right down Main Street without having a
chance to say 'hello' to anybody." In spite of the
quiet, though, there were at least a generous baker's
dozen of boys in and around Lakeville whose hearts
beat hippety-hop whenever they stopped to think of the
game that afternoon.</p>

<p>For the baseball season had gone well. The whole
school year, indeed, had been a procession of athletic
triumphs, first in football, then in basketball, and finally
in baseball. Best of all, every last boy and girl in
Lakeville High was ready to admit that the Black Eagle
Scouts had done their share and more. In the beginning,
of course, the patrol was a target for scorn;
but gradually, as its members proved that the Scout
way of doing things was a good way, and made for
harmony and loyalty and the pull-together spirit that
won victories, sentiment began to swing toward the
organization until, in the end, it was pretty generally
agreed that to be a Boy Scout was to be somebody
worth while in high school.</p>

<p>With two championships stowed safely away, it was
only natural that the baseball season should have begun
with a hip-hip-hurray. With but two exceptions,
every boy in school had tried for the team, and the
lucky candidates had won their places only after the
hardest kind of struggle. Of the Scouts, Roundy was
at first base, Jump at second, and Specs at short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Bunny and Bi alternated in the pitcher's box. For the
rest of the school, Barrett caught, Sheffield held down
third base, and the outfield was made up of Collins,
Kiproy and Turner.</p>

<p>Professor Leland had proved a most enthusiastic
coach, and the lively competition for places on the
team had kept all the players on tiptoe. The nine,
moreover, had run on greased rollers. Buck Claxton
himself had nominated Bunny for captaincy of the
team, and by the best sort of example had shown that
the leader's orders were law. With this spirit and discipline,
the team had progressed steadily from victory
to victory. Its one setback had come from a semi-professional
outfit of Dunkirk, and that score had been
only seven to four against Lakeville. They had beaten
Dunkirk High, Grant City, Deerfield, Mason, Harrison
City and Elkana. Belden, slated for the last game of
the season, was not only the one team in the district
that remained undefeated, but also it could and did lay
claim to the championship of the State. To beat
Belden, therefore, meant to round out the school year
with pennants in three major sports.</p>

<p>"Why didn't Bonfire try for the baseball team?"
Specs asked suddenly. "I've never understood that.
He tried for everything else."</p>

<p>Bunny peered down the street for the expected
Scouts before he answered. "I don't know. Bonfire's
hard to understand. But he had some good reason;
it wasn't because he was afraid to try."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's seen all the games and been at all the practices,"
said Specs, stretching his legs. "He has eyes
like&mdash;like a fox. Do you remember that tip he gave
me about the Dunkirk pitcher with his funny inshoot?
But he hasn't even handled a baseball, not since Molly's
picnic."</p>

<p>Specs was still chuckling over the memory when the
appearance of Jump and Roundy changed the subject.
Bunny hopped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Now we can start. We meet the rest of them at
the schoolhouse at nine-fifteen."</p>

<p>"By to-night we'll be State champs," said the placid
and confident Roundy. "I saw Molly and Mr. Sefton
and Horace Hibbs scooting down the street in the
Sefton automobile early this morning. They had
streamers and pennants enough to open a store. I'm
glad they are going to be there to cheer for us."</p>

<p>Carrying their uniforms in bulky suit cases and
telescopes, the four Scouts started down the street.</p>

<p>"Everybody's gone," observed Jump, as they
strolled down Maple Avenue toward the high school.
"Seems a shame to leave the town like this."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are some chickens and a couple of dogs
and about a thousand pet cats left behind," Specs retorted.
"They can take care of things." He looked
up the street. "Hello! Prof. and the others are
waiting for us at the corner."</p>

<p>On the high-school lawn, opposite Grady's barn, the
remainder of the team, with substitutes and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
others, were gathered. Professor Leland was looking
at his watch.</p>

<p>"How about Sheffield?" queried Bunny, joining the
coach. "Has he come yet?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "Sheffield's always two
minutes late. He has seven miles to cover in that
machine of his, but he generally waits till the last
second." He glanced about anxiously. "We have
nearly the entire squad here, and Ferris can play third
if he has to, but I want Sheffield."</p>

<p>"I might wait here," Bunny suggested, "say, for
ten minutes. Roy always leaves his car in Grady's
barn, so he's sure to pass this way. When he does
come, I'll get him to the station on the run."</p>

<p>The coach breathed a sigh of relief. "That's the
plan, Payton. I'll leave the uniforms and bat bag with
you, too, and you can pile them on Ernie Langer's
dray when he comes. Then you can ride with him
to the station and keep him from going to sleep."</p>

<p>Since the entire patrol had voted to go to Laurel,
Bunny ventured another suggestion. "There are
eight of us here who have worked together; nine altogether,
counting Prissler, who is training to be a tenderfoot.
If we all stay with the baggage, we can carry
it to the station, in case Langer should be late."</p>

<p>Professor Leland considered. "Langer is coming,
all right. But if I thought there was a chance of his
being behind time, I'd let the squad carry the baggage
to the station now. Still, your way keeps us from taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
any chances at all." He paused to study his watch.
"Remember, the train stops at 9:40 only to let off
and take on passengers. You <i>must</i> be there on time.
At three o'clock this afternoon, when the game is
called, I don't want to play with four or five substitutes."</p>

<p>"We'll be there," chorused the Scouts, while Bunny
and Bi carefully set their watches with that of the
coach.</p>

<p>It was eighteen minutes past nine when Professor
Leland and his players, minus the Scouts, started up
the street toward the station.</p>

<p>"We can wait till nine-thirty if we have to," Bunny
decided, "and then make the train by the skin of our
teeth. But I hope old Slowpoke Langer and his dray
come along before that. Roy Sheffield ought to be
here now."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Langer, however, who arrived first,
sleepily jogging his horses toward the corner. At exactly
twenty-six minutes past nine he drew up beside
the pile of baggage.</p>

<p>"Whoa, there! Whoa! Ain't been waiting for
me, have you?" he inquired genially, as he removed his
straw hat to wipe his forehead.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you ever since I've known
you," answered Specs. "What are those horses of
yours&mdash;one cylinder or two?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langer smiled contentedly. "You might not
think it," he observed, "but these here horses used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
be fire horses in Elkana when they was young. And
they're just as good a team to-day as that pair of plugs
they got in our fire station." He climbed laboriously
from his seat, with some intention of assisting the
Scouts in loading the bags and baseball apparatus into
the dray. But as the boys were tidily finishing the
job before Mr. Langer fully made up his mind about
the best way to begin, he thought better of his ambition,
and leaned one arm on the wagon and went on
with his conversation.</p>

<p>"Take that fire department in this here town," he
ruminated, picking a spear of grass to chew between
words. "Why, it ain't run like a fire department any
more than it's run like a church." He squinted
thoughtfully at a pebble in the road. "Come to think
of it, there ain't much difference between that fire department
and a church. There's just one man of the
Second Reformed Church left in Lakeville to-day, and
that's Pete Mullett, the janitor; and there's just one
man left in the fire department, and that's Dave Hendershot,
the driver."</p>

<p>Bunny pricked up his ears. "You don't mean
there's only one man to hitch up the hose cart and put
out the fire?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langer nodded. "Yep. Dave was left in
charge, with three helpers, and they told him they
wanted to go to Dunkirk. And Dave was good-natured,
and they was just volunteers, anyhow, and he
let 'em go. Of course, I'll be around to give Dave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
a hand, but that ain't no way to fight fires." Mr.
Langer nodded more decisively than before and
plucked a second blade of grass.</p>

<p>"Coming late, the way Royal Sheffield does, isn't
playing the game either," said Specs suddenly. "We
have just one minute more to wait. It's 9:29 already."</p>

<p>Bunny verified the time. As Specs said, the missing
player had but a single minute of grace before the
procession started toward the station.</p>

<p>"He may get here on time, even if we don't hustle
him up," suggested S. S.</p>

<p>Bonfire Cree laughed. "He'd have missed the Harrison
City game if the train hadn't been held up on
account of a hot box."</p>

<p>"He's a dandy, he is!" commented Specs. "Back
before you fellows won that basketball game for him,
I heard him say once that we Scouts weren't interested
in anything except ourselves, but I notice he never
puts himself out for anybody."</p>

<p>"Give him a fair show, Specs," Bunny suggested
gently. "Remember, he isn't here to speak for himself."</p>

<p>"He'll be speaking for himself in two seconds,"
said Bonfire, pointing down the street toward a scarlet
motor car which at that moment was tearing along near
the corner.</p>

<p>Barely braking enough to turn without skidding,
Royal Sheffield drove the automobile up the driveway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
to the barn; then, a moment later, lounged down the
path to the Scouts.</p>

<p>"Make it fast, Sheff," warned Bunny. "We have
just time to catch the train, not a second more. Throw
your stuff on the dray. All right, we 're off. How
about it, Mr. Langer? Can we all pile on your
wagon?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langer nodded. Promptly, without waiting
for the captain of the team to decide the matter, Sheffield
scrambled up to the driver's seat.</p>

<p>"I notice you're making yourself comfortable!"
snapped Specs, balancing uneasily on the side of the
dray.</p>

<p>"Is that so!" Sheffield flung back carelessly.
"Well, I'm following your lead. I notice you fellows
have been hanging around to ride to the station."</p>

<p>"Hanging around!" Specs raised his voice angrily.
"Why, the only reason we stayed behind was to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better cut it, Specs!" Bunny said decisively.</p>

<p>A silence followed. With much slapping of lines
and verbal encouragement, Mr. Langer waked his fire
horses and set them in motion. In time, even, they
broke into an unwieldy trot, jolting and jouncing the
stiff-springed dray over the ruts.</p>

<p>"Too much luxury for me!" groaned Bonfire.
"I'd rather run alongside than be shaken to pieces."</p>

<p>He dropped from the dray, glancing back down the
street.</p>

<p>"Bunny! Oh, Bunny! Look!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>He was standing in the middle of the road, jaw
dropped, eyes bulging, forefinger pointed toward the
corner from which they had come.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bonfire?"</p>

<p>"It's a fire&mdash;back there&mdash;by the corner! There's
a house on fire!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">ALONG THE FLOOR</p>

<p class="pn p2">Placing both hands on the sideboard of the dray,
Bunny vaulted lightly to the ground. From where
Bonfire stood, the thin eddy of smoke could be seen
looping over the tree tops at the corner.</p>

<p>"It's Peterson's house!"</p>

<p>Bonfire shook his head. "The smoke shows too
far north for that. It's either Crawford's or some
shed near there."</p>

<p>For a long moment Bunny watched the white wreath
tail up above the highest leaves; then, abruptly, he
raced after the jogging dray.</p>

<p>"Stop that team!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Mr. Langer pulled up deliberately, hastened a little
in the process, perhaps, by Roundy, who seemed on the
point of taking the reins into his own hands.</p>

<p>"Everybody out! We can't leave a fire like that
with nobody in town."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" snapped Sheffield. "We'll turn in an
alarm at the station. What's the fire department for?
Let it burn!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Langer seemed in doubt. "Wal, I dunno." He
scratched his head thoughtfully. "I dunno. Mebbe,
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're hired to get us down to the station," Sheffield
reminded him. "The best thing for you to do is
to hurry up and make that train."</p>

<p>Bunny hesitated. The welfare of the baseball team
which he captained demanded that no time be lost.
On the other hand, if a serious fire had started, it was
more important to check it than to play any game.</p>

<p>"If there is a real blaze&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter whether it's a real blaze or not,"
Sheffield interrupted. "We are on our way to play for
the high-school championship of the State. That's
more important than anything else."</p>

<p>"No, Sheff," disagreed Bunny; "no, it isn't. Winning
a baseball championship wouldn't be as important
as saving Lakeville from a bad fire. Now, would
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's probably only a smudge," urged Sheffield.
"How about it, Langer? Didn't you see a bonfire
over there?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langer scratched his head again. "I dunno if
I did and I dunno if I didn't. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bunny made up his mind. "Drive ahead, Langer.
Sheffield, you see that the stuff gets to the station on
time and tell Professor Leland that we will catch the
11:30 train. That will bring us to the Belden field by
just three o'clock. Scouts over here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost before Mr. Langer could get under way, his
dray was lightened of its load of Black Eagles, who
scrambled to the ground, following Bunny and Bonfire
at a dead run.</p>

<p>"It's not a little blaze," panted the observant Bonfire.
"Look how that smoke hangs in a cloud over the
trees. It's coming from the top of some building."</p>

<p>"It's the Crawford house!" Specs urged, as he
sprinted up to the two leaders. "You can tell it's the
Crawfords', because&mdash;No, it isn't either. It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bunny, Bonfire and Specs came to a paralyzed halt.
In one voice, they finished the sentence:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Grady's barn!"</p>

<p>Already that building had loomed into sight. From
an opening near the peak of the roof, smoke was
leisurely twining into the air, as if it had a perfect
right to be doing that sort of thing in that sort of a
place. No one else in town seemed to have noticed
the warning, and a thicker puff of smoke brought no
answering cry of "Fire!"</p>

<p>"Let her go!" said Specs spitefully. "We will
turn in an alarm and keep it from burning anything
else, but we might just as well let the old shack go up
in smoke. Grady has it insured."</p>

<p>"But Sheffield's automobile is in there," protested
Bonfire, "and that isn't insured. I heard Roy say so."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," Specs agreed calmly.
"But Mister Royal Sheffield thinks we haven't any
business monkeying with fires this morning, and I vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
we go back to the station and tell him that we were
mistaken and that he was right."</p>

<p>Bunny frowned. "We'll go right on being Scouts
and living up to the Scout law, just as we did before
we ever knew Sheffield. Jump and S. S., you two
pike down to the fire department and hustle Dave Hendershot
up here with the hose cart. Prissler, you chase
downtown and rouse people. Roundy, break into the
schoolhouse and ring the bell for all you're worth.
Nap, you take the school telephone and call Central and
the fire department. The rest of us will do what we
can right here."</p>

<p>However much the Scouts would have preferred to
stay at the scene of action, they hesitated not at all in
obeying these necessarily curt orders. Three runners
scurried away toward Main Street; two others made a
bee line for the janitor's entrance of the high school.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" grunted Specs. "Now we can go
ahead and be heroes and save dear old Roy's car for
him. I'd certainly like to see the blamed thing saved&mdash;that
is, all except the tires and the motor and the tool
box and the lights and a few other things."</p>

<p>Whenever Specs reached this particular mood, it
was best to let him talk his way out of it. Bunny
ignored him completely and ran toward the burning
building.</p>

<p>Grady's barn was the usual two-story structure, its
peaked roof topped by an old-fashioned cupola. At
the front, two swinging doors were locked by a wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
bar within, a smaller side entrance being used for ordinary
comings and goings.</p>

<p>"Locked with a big padlock," said Bunny, testing
the side door while Bonfire and Specs hurried to the
west side of the building.</p>

<p>Bi returned from an excursion to the rear. "Back
door's nailed fast," he reported. "There are iron bars
across the inside of that back window, too."</p>

<p>Through this latter opening, Bi had seen the smoke
thickening inside, but he had failed to discover any
way of breaking through to smother it. It was evident
that when Mr. Grady had turned over his horseless
barn to Royal Sheffield, he had made it thoroughly
burglar proof.</p>

<p>"If I had an ax," Bi muttered wistfully, "I'd
smash through that door in a hurry."</p>

<p>With a common impulse, Bunny and Bi picked up a
long board, to use as a battering-ram against the sagging
double door. Under the blows, the barn resounded,
but the doors remained as tightly shut as before.</p>

<p>"Got to break through pretty soon or stop trying,"
Bunny gasped, as they halted the attack to regain wind.
"If we once get inside anywhere, we can open those
double doors and roll out the car. After that, we might
save the barn. But if the gasoline ever explodes&mdash;well,
that will finish everything."</p>

<p>"Let's try it again!" Bi lunged against the door
with fierce energy. "Maybe the big wooden bar that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
holds across the middle will jump loose if we jar it
enough. Ugh!" He grunted as the board struck the
door.</p>

<p>"All together, Bi! Once more! I think I felt it
move." They hammered the wood home, but in spite
of the whirlwind of blows the door did nothing but
sag a little and stick fast.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" ejaculated Bunny, as they
halted after this assault. "Roundy's found the bell,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"<i>Dang! Bang! Dang! Bang!</i>" The clapper of
the high-school bell was swinging wilder and harder
against the metal sides than ever before in its short
life.</p>

<p>"Now, if that brings help, and if Nap gets a little
action over the telephone, and if Jump and S. S. bring
up the hose cart, we have a chance even yet. Where's
Bonfire? And where's Specs?"</p>

<p>As if in answer to his name, Bonfire appeared, red-faced
and breathless, holding a short two-by-four in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Looked all over Peterson's woodshed for an ax,
but couldn't find a thing except this. You can see
the fire through the little stall window. It's just
beginning to wake up. Didn't Specs find anything?"</p>

<p>"Specs! Isn't he with you?"</p>

<p>"With me? No!" Bonfire's eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"He started with me. He was going to the Crawfords'
and&mdash;let's see&mdash;he turned and&mdash;" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
boy stopped speaking. Fumbling the plank in his
hand, he dropped it and then scooped it from the
ground in a rush toward the door.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he shouted, attacking the barn in a
wild burst of frenzy. "We've got to break in!
We've got to! Specs is inside!"</p>

<p>Bunny caught him by the arm. "We can't break
through here. It's solid. How do you know Specs
is inside?"</p>

<p>The other Scout was quivering with excitement.
"I know it. I looked through the stall window.
There was a board loose in the floor, near the fire. I
pointed it out to him. For a joke, I told him a thin
fellow might crawl underneath the barn, pry it loose,
and come up inside. And he's done it! We've
got to get him out!"</p>

<p>The school bell still clanged at top speed. Far
down the street, Bunny could see two men running.
He fancied he could hear galloping hoofs and the
rumble of the hose cart. But if Specs was wallowing
in that smother of smoke, all this help would come too
late. He pounded on the side of the barn with his
futile fist.</p>

<p>"Specs! Specs!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Bi ground his fingers into his palms. "If he can
only get to the door, he can open it, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no answering sound from within.</p>

<p>Bonfire, who had disappeared, darted suddenly
from one side of the barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's in there," he said. His face was white,
and he spoke jerkily. "You can see his tracks. I
crawled under. The board has been lifted up,
but the blaze is all over the hole and I couldn't
get through."</p>

<p>Something cried to be done. Something must be
done. As Bunny tried to collect his thoughts, his
eye glimpsed a tiny gap between the base of the door
on the right and the top of the ramp. It stretched
near the hinge side, high enough to take the end of
a plank. With a shout of relief, he slapped the end
of the board into the crevice. Using the two-by-four
as a fulcrum, he began levering the door upward and
outward.</p>

<p>"All together now! Smash that hinge!" he
gulped, choking from a whiff of smoke that puffed
into his face from the crack.</p>

<p>This command was unnecessary. Already the other
two were throwing all their weight and strength
on the long end of the lever.</p>

<p>"Hard! Everybody, hard!"</p>

<p>Came a creaking, groaning, splintering of the wood.
It was the signal of the break to come. The Scouts
were bracing for a last effort when, quite without
warning or effort on their part, the bar stretched
across the inside of the double door swung upward,
the sides flew open, and out stumbled Specs. Himself,
he had unloosed the holding bar and opened the
doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm all right!" he gagged. "Not burned! Get
the car out quick! Leave me alone! I'll be O. K.
in a minute, I tell you!" He staggered over to a plot
of grass.</p>

<p>While Specs lay flung on the ground, blinking his
smoke-reddened eyes and breathing heavily, the other
three wheeled the car into the open just as the hose
cart, carrying S. S. and Jump and a crew of four others,
drew up at the hydrant.</p>

<p>"Prissler ran down the street and yelled 'Fire!' at
the top of his voice," explained S. S. "That's how
these men happened to know about it and run to the
fire house. He&mdash;There he comes now, with another
bunch he's roused."</p>

<p>Fortunately, except for a little scorched paint, the
car was undamaged. As for the fire itself, within
ten minutes the volunteer workers gathered by bell
and telephone and little Prissler's Paul Revere race
through the village had the flames changing into a
welter of thick, white smoke. The barn had suffered,
but it was not beyond repair.</p>

<p>"I got in all right," Specs explained to the boys,
"and I had a wet handkerchief tied over my face,
and I crawled along the floor as if I was looking for a
needle, and I generally acted the way a fireman ought
to act. I'd been all right, too, if I hadn't bumped
my elbow and then stuck my head up to see what did
it. I must have swallowed some smoke or something,
because I had to lie quiet till I could get enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
strength back to finish the job. That was when I
heard you calling to me."</p>

<p>"But I thought you didn't care about saving Sheffield's
car," teased Roundy, who had come back from
his bell ringing.</p>

<p>"I don't!" Specs flared indignantly. "But if I
hadn't tried to help, I'd have been breaking about half
the Scout laws. Just the same," he added a little viciously,
"I'm going to tell Royal Sheffield that I wish
it had been somebody else's car."</p>

<p>At this characteristic fling, the Black Eagles rolled
merrily on the grass, winding up in an informal pyramid,
of which Specs was the bottom layer.</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Bunny, suddenly piling off.
"We had better find out about that later train."</p>

<p>It was Nap, arriving on the scene from his telephoning,
who capped this remark.</p>

<p>"I called up the station," he said. "That's what
kept me. The team was gone. The second train&mdash;the
one we thought we were going on&mdash;was taken
off this week. There isn't another on the schedule
that will get us to Belden in time for the baseball
game!"</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">TOUCH AND GO</p>

<p class="pn p2">The Black Eagle Patrol stared blankly at Nap.</p>

<p>"No train!" S. S. repeated dully.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of one." Nap had an irritating air of
being pleased to act as bearer of bad news. "And the
only possible automobile road on this side of the hills
makes it a six-hour trip. That's why the Seftons
started at seven this morning."</p>

<p>"I suppose," suggested Jump, somewhat nettled, "I
suppose you are going to say you're Waterlooed."</p>

<p>Nap shook his head with a superior smile.</p>

<p>"If you remember&mdash;I mean, if you've ever read
about that campaign of Napoleon's when he crossed
the Alps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't remember it and I never read about
it," Bi said bluntly, "and I don't expect to read about
it, either, unless some teacher makes me; but if you
have an idea up your sleeve, shake it out."</p>

<p>"What's the plan, Nap?" Bunny queried patiently.</p>

<p>"Just this." Nap hid his disappointment at being
cut short. "The R. A. &amp; S. railroad runs through
Harrison City, and the station is only about a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
from the other side of the lake. I have telephoned all
over, and here's what I found out: There's a train
over there, leaving Harrison City at 10:50. Of
course, the R. A. &amp; S. doesn't run to Belden, but you
can get to Deerfield on it, where there is a bus line to
Belden, sort of doubling back a ways, you see. If we
make that 10:50 train, we'll be at the ball park by
two o'clock."</p>

<p>Bunny nodded. "Good work, Nap; that fixes us.
Now, if Roundy can borrow the launch&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roundy was sure he could.</p>

<p>"&mdash;we'll scoot across the lake, leave the boat at
the yacht club there, hike the mile to the Harrison
City station, and catch the train. Come on; we
haven't any time to spare."</p>

<p>It took only a few seconds to make sure that their
services at the deceased fire were no longer needed,
and that Royal Sheffield's automobile would be safely
stowed in the garage on Main Street. Once assured
on these points, the patrol struck out, at an alternate
walk and trot they often practiced, by the shortest of
short cuts to the boathouse.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how well things went, so far as
getting started was concerned. The boathouse key
was hanging conveniently in its place; the launch's gasoline
tank was filled to the brim; the engine started off
as promptly as if it were accustomed to acting that
way, instead of having what Roundy aptly called
"cranky fits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll make it in a walk," announced Nap, consulting
his watch. "It's just 9:57 now. We'll cover
those four miles of lake in thirty minutes. That's
10:27. Maybe we'll waste five minutes landing and
getting the boat taken care of; that will bring it to
10:32. And if we can't cover the mile to Harrison
City and get on the train in eighteen minutes more, we
ought to turn in our Scout badges."</p>

<p>The others nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"Somebody camping on Shadow Island," broke
in Bonfire from his post of lookout in the bow of the
boat.</p>

<p>"I don't see any smoke," Bi commented. "I don't
see any tents, either. There's somebody standing on
the shore, but there's a boat there, too. Chances are
it's just a fisherman."</p>

<p>Bonfire pointed to a little gap in a maple grove.</p>

<p>"Do you see that line of washing to the left, hung
between those two trees? Did you ever hear of any
fisherman who went over to Shadow Island to do his
washing?"</p>

<p>"I'm licked," Bi admitted. "Who is it? Are you
enough of a Sherlock Holmes to tell us from here?"</p>

<p>"I know who it is." S. S. joined the conversation.
"It's two families from Harrison City, cousins of
Marion Genevieve Chester. She told me so, and she's
over there visiting them to-day."</p>

<p>Specs snorted. "I guess it won't break her heart
if we pass right by without calling on her. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
about as much to do with us as she has with a bunch
of rattlesnakes, and that's not a whole lot."</p>

<p>"She thinks we still dislike her for being president
of the student association," Bunny observed mildly.
"And she hasn't forgotten how Bi allowed her to get
scared at Molly's picnic. She just thinks we haven't
any use for her and wouldn't lift a finger to get
her out of any trouble."</p>

<p>"Marion Genevieve Chester! Wow, what a
name!" mocked Specs.</p>

<p>The laughter that followed was a little uncertain.
Seating arrangements at school had made the girl,
Bunny and S. S. all next door neighbors. To the surprise
of these two Scouts, at least, they had found her
snobbishness mainly the outcome of a solitary childhood,
a thin veneer that was slowly but surely wearing
off. Though her fancied superiority to the other pupils
had not yet vanished, the give and take of school
life was gradually rubbing it away.</p>

<p>Smoothly, purringly, the launch clove its way toward
the yacht club on the far side of the lake, while Shadow
Island, the scene of Bunny's initiation into the Black
Eagle Patrol,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> dropped astern.</p>

<p>"On the home stretch and running like a watch,"
Roundy declared. "We'll have time to get there and
play an inning of baseball before the train starts. We
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shipwreck ahead!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Bonfire's cry that brought the passengers of
the boat to a sudden alertness.</p>

<p>"Tipped just now! Two of them in it! One of
them stood up! There they are!"</p>

<p>The little craft ahead was keel up, with two heads
bobbing alongside and two arms hugging tightly the
side. Faintly, the light breeze brought cries of distress.</p>

<p>"One of them's a girl!"</p>

<p>"They're both girls!"</p>

<p>"What are they hollering for? They're all right
if they just hang on. They can see us coming."</p>

<p>"You mean they're all right if they don't get
panicky."</p>

<p>"Turn the engine loose, Roundy."</p>

<p>Roundy wiped a perspiring forehead. "The engine's
doing all it can right now."</p>

<p>Bunny gave rapid-fire directions. "Roundy, if
there's any rescuing to do, you're the prize swimmer;
so you'll do it. S. S., you handle the engine and the
steering gear. Everybody else, stand ready to help.
Bring our starboard up as close to the boat as you can
and hold it there."</p>

<p>Shoes and stockings kicked off, Roundy leaned over
the side. "If they are all right, we can just pull them
in; but if they are too scared, I'll jump in after them."
He broke off to chuckle.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I'll eat my hat if the girl on the right isn't Marion
Genevieve Chester!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an eager second of straining.</p>

<p>"It's Marion Genevieve, all right, and she's so
scared she doesn't know her stylish name."</p>

<p>"Bring us up close, S. S. Graze it if you can."</p>

<p>No doubt remained that one of the two girls clinging
to the upturned boat was Marion Genevieve Chester.
But while her companion saved strength by holding
quietly and allowing the water to support as much
of her weight as possible, Marion Genevieve not only
exhausted herself by screaming, but in addition wasted
her muscle reserve by striving vainly to pull herself
higher out of the water.</p>

<p>The launch was now within twenty feet. It slowed
down.</p>

<p>"Better be ready to go overboard, Roundy. Always
the chance of an accident, you know."</p>

<p>Bunny had hardly given the warning when, with a
last frantic cry, the girl threw up two wild arms and
splashed back into the water.</p>

<p>"Go over, Roundy!"</p>

<p>Before her head could sink beneath the surface, the
Scouts realized that something had happened to
Roundy Magoon. Kicking wildly with his left leg,
he had drawn back from the rail to the cockpit.</p>

<p>"Roundy!"</p>

<p>Marion Genevieve's pale face, washed over by a
tiny ripple, slipped beneath the water.</p>

<p>Snarling as though a wild beast had attacked him,
Roundy snatched at the coil of rope that Nap had accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
kicked into his path. With his fingers, he
tore at the hemp line that had snarled about his ankle.</p>

<p>The girl was above water again, coughing and
spluttering and groping for some tangible support.</p>

<p>"<i>Roundy!</i>"</p>

<p>And then, quite without command or plan, the balance
of the Black Eagle Patrol, plus little Prissler, took
his place.</p>

<p>Bunny was over first, with Bi, Jump and Specs close
seconds. Nap followed, hard pressed by Bonfire.
Then S. S. and Prissler, and, last of all, the freed
Roundy.</p>

<p>Swiftly, surely, they cut their way to the helpless
girl, with Bunny in the lead. Catching her dress near
the back of her neck, he held her face clear of the
water till, by clasping both hands under her chin, he
was able to swim slowly on his back and tow her to
safety.</p>

<p>Jump and Nap swam alongside; Bonfire was lending
a hand to the other shipwrecked miss; Prissler, who
was obviously not as much at home in the water as
the others, wisely put back for the launch; while S. S.,
ploughing through the water like a fish, was already
clambering aboard, ready to start the engine. Bi,
Roundy and Specs joined forces in towing the upturned
craft toward the power boat.</p>

<p>The rest was comparatively simple. The Scouts
made no work at all of climbing back into the launch;
and, with feet well braced, Bi and Specs easily lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the two girls over the side. Marion Genevieve sank
down on the leather cushions, weak and faint, though
frightened rather than harmed. The other girl, who
introduced herself as Marion Genevieve's cousin, was
able to laugh good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"We stood up in the boat," she said, "because we
wanted to change seats. And&mdash;well, that's all!"</p>

<p>"It may be all as far as you are concerned," thought
more than one Scout, "but we're going somewhere in
a hurry, and now we'll have to take you back to
Shadow Island and tow that capsized boat, to boot."</p>

<p>But nobody was impolite enough to say this aloud.</p>

<p>Whatever Bunny wished to do, it was plain that
he had no choice in the matter. Though Marion Genevieve
was not dangerously ill or faint, she kept up a
moaning for her mother that could not be disregarded.
Roundy, still a little disgruntled over his mishap, turned
to the patrol leader, who nodded toward Shadow Island.
With a line fast to the swamped boat, the
launch engine started and they began to move slowly
toward the shore line. It seemed to every boy that
hours were being wasted, but nobody complained.</p>

<p>Not till she was once more on dry land did Marion
Genevieve seem to come fully to herself. Then, while
her relatives were still trying to thank the patrol, she
suddenly remarked, "Why&mdash;why <i>all</i> of you are
wet!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't help it," said the cheerful Specs. "We
all dove off the boat and forgot to take our umbrellas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>There were several emotions trying to express themselves
on Marion Genevieve's face, but all she managed
to say was, "I&mdash;I thank you&mdash;all of you! I'm
very, very grateful."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, Marion Genevieve," Specs
laughed.</p>

<p>The girl's glance wavered. She picked at her wet
dress. "I&mdash;Please!" she said imploringly. And
then it came out, as if it wrenched her very soul. "My
name isn't Marion Genevieve," she told them. "It's
Mary; my middle name is Jennie. I was called after
two aunts of mine."</p>

<p>She was staring straight at Bunny now. He felt his
cheeks redden. It was a hard position in which to put
a fellow, he told himself, and probably he'd say the
wrong thing. But when he spoke, it was honestly and
naturally.</p>

<p>"I think Mary is a nice name," he said.</p>

<p>The girl's low "Thank you!" meant a good deal
more to the Scouts than they were able to understand
just then. Afterward, Specs tried to put it into words.</p>

<p>"She said it," he told the others, "as if she was
sorry she had been so&mdash;so snippish to us, and as if
she wanted us to forget and make up and&mdash;and everything.
I'll bet you Mary's going to be a regular girl
after this. I like her about twice as much as I ever
did before."</p>

<p>But this was afterward. At the moment, the Scouts
merely nodded in an embarrassed manner and set about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the task of shoving the launch into deep water, despite
an almost irresistible appeal from the campers to wait
for a treat of strawberries and cake and lemonade.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Roundy, when Shadow Island
once more lay astern, "I'm glad we were there when
we were needed. Just the same, I'm afraid we've
lost out. I'll talk to the engine, but we can't go any
faster than just so fast."</p>

<p>"There's time yet," Bunny insisted; "there must be
time yet."</p>

<p>Far and faint across the two-mile stretch of water
came the sound of a bell. It pealed from the tower of
Harrison City's big church: four chimes&mdash;half-past
ten.</p>

<p>Two miles of water and a mile of land to cover in
twenty minutes! The Scouts looked despairingly at
the steadily throbbing engine.</p>

<p>"It can't be done!" muttered Roundy. "It can't
be done!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">DEAD WIRES</p>

<p class="pn p2">"We must have a chance yet," S. S. insisted weakly.</p>

<p>"About as much of a chance as a dish of ice cream
at a Sunday-School picnic," grinned Specs.</p>

<p>Bunny cleared his throat. "I know how you fellows
feel about this, and I know just what we are up
against. Twenty minutes isn't much time for the distance
we have to cover. Just the same, I've made up
my mind that we are going to be at the ball park in
Belden by three o'clock this afternoon, even if we have
to build a toboggan and slide there. But we're not
going to give up, not if I know anything about this
patrol. We've never quit yet when something had to
be done."</p>

<p>There was a general murmur of agreement. Little
Prissler said primly, "That's the spirit that moves
mountains!"</p>

<p>"And if it should turn out, at five minutes of three,"
added Bunny, "that we are still trying to cross this
lake, I'd vote for keeping right on toward Belden till
we reached there."</p>

<p>"That's what we all say!" shouted Bi enthusiastically;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"that is, if some near-sighted laundry doesn't
catch us and hang us up on a line to dry."</p>

<p>In the laughter that followed, the nine boys began to
take stock of their soaked clothing, wringing and pressing
out as much of the water as they could.</p>

<p>"The bullgine's picking up a little," said Roundy
hopefully, squirting a little oil on the exposed running
parts and tightening the grease cups. "If we don't
touch shore ahead of time, I'm a tenderfoot."</p>

<p>With freshened courage, they waited the landing.
And because neither breakdowns nor stoppages came
their way, they climbed upon the yacht pier at exactly
10:39. While Roundy arranged with the keeper to
look after the launch, Bunny interviewed a fisherman
on the best way to get to Harrison City.</p>

<p>"The main road is that macadamized pike right
there," the man informed him. "It's a good mile and
a quarter to the Charles City station."</p>

<p>Bunny gasped. The situation was even worse than
he had imagined.</p>

<p>"But if you are in a hurry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are, Mister; we're in a mighty big hurry."</p>

<p>"Then take the old wagon road to the right," advised
the fisherman. "It's a short cut over a couple of
little hills. A bad stretch of road, I'm telling you, but
only three quarters of a mile to Harrison City that
way. On foot, you'll get there a lot sooner than if you
follow the main highway."</p>

<p>"We want to catch the 10:50 train."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll make it if you keep your legs moving."</p>

<p>A series of short blasts on the patrol leader's whistle
gathered the eight boys about him. In a few quick
words, Bunny explained the lay of the roads.</p>

<p>"We'll take up the Scout's pace, and keep at it till
we reach the station. We have almost ten minutes
to make three quarters of a mile. I'll lead, and I want
each fellow to hang close to the heels of the one ahead."</p>

<p>"I'll be rearguard," said Specs, as the nine boys
broke into a trot. "Remember, Roundy, if you drop
back, I'll&mdash;I'll pick you up and carry you into
Harrison City."</p>

<p>There was nothing about the road to hinder people
on foot. Deep ruts and gullies made it practically impassable
for finicky automobiles, but the nine boys
strung out in single file and thus avoided bad places
and fallen branches that had toppled upon the trail.
Less than a quarter mile from the lake, they skimmed
the crest of the first hill with every fellow hanging
close to his pace-setter.</p>

<p>"It's like taking candy from a baby," Specs grinned,
as the group dropped into a walk. "What do you say,
Bunny, if we make the run a hundred yards and the
walk fifty? We can do it easy enough."</p>

<p>Bunny was unwilling. "Yes, we could," he admitted,
"but we have a ball game to play this afternoon,
and I guess we'll need all our strength to win it."</p>

<p>The road was a little better now. Trees that met
overhead threw a grateful shade upon the hikers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
There were even clumps of wild flowers waiting to be
appreciated by anybody in the mood to look at them.
But the Scouts and the Scout-trained Prissler had their
minds set upon catching that train, and the most beautiful
flowers in the world could have bloomed their
heads off without getting more than a passing glance.</p>

<p>"Off again!" Bunny announced, giving the signal
for the jog.</p>

<p>They wound past a clump of trees and around a turn
to the left. Without warning, Bunny slowed and
halted. Behind him, Scout bumped Scout, like a row
of dominoes that is set falling.</p>

<p>A man with a cane faced Bunny. "I&mdash;it's&mdash;"
He stammered incoherently before he loosed a flood
of words. "Boys, I must have help! I must have
it! I must ask you to help me!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" called Specs, who had not
heard the request. He was rubbing an affronted nose
that had collided with Roundy's back.</p>

<p>It was now evident to Bunny that the stranger was
older than he had seemed at first. His face was lined
with wrinkles. His back was twisted and bent, as if
from rheumatism. When he spoke, his voice quavered
uncertainly.</p>

<p>"My wife and I, we live back there in that little
frame house. She's just getting over a long spell
of sickness, and it is necessary for me to be in touch
with the Harrison City doctor night and day. But now
my telephone won't work; it's gone dead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll leave word at Harrison City."</p>

<p>The old man shook his head despairingly. "It's a
bad time of week to get anything done. This is Saturday,
you know, and they might not come&mdash;they
might not come till Monday."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you expect us to do, anyhow?" demanded
the irritated Specs.</p>

<p>The old gentleman's hand trembled as he gestured.
"I&mdash;I don't know. Perhaps one of you could go to
the telephone office and maybe stay right there and
explain how much we needed the 'phone fixed and not
give up till they started somebody out here to fix it."</p>

<p>There were five seconds of uncomfortable silence,
broken by Bunny. "We might do better than that.
If Handy were here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Roundy knows a lot about telephones," suggested
Jump.</p>

<p>"Not very much," Roundy admitted slowly. "But
I can tell if any of the wires are disconnected, or if
the battery is dead, or if anything big is the matter
with the instrument."</p>

<p>"That's enough; that's plenty!" Bunny was
thinking hard and fast. "We all know a little something
about electricity. Roundy, you go to the telephone
and look it over. I'll meet you there." Roundy
was off on a run. The old gentleman, staring in blank
surprise, suddenly comprehended and shouted that the
telephone was in the hall, just inside the front door.</p>

<p>"Now for the insulators," Bunny said briskly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
"You notice how the wires run from the house along
those trees, with the insulators on the limbs. If somebody
shinnies up each tree, we'll soon discover whether
the trouble's between here and the regular poles."</p>

<p>There was no time to discuss matters with the aged
cottager, who seemed still dazed and wondering. Like
so many squirrels, the boys scattered and began
squirming their way up the proper trunks.</p>

<p>Eight trees carried the glass insulators. Fortunately,
however, the one nearest the house could be examined
with the aid of a friendly stepladder. Bunny
was up and down in the twinkling of an eye. With the
other volunteer repairmen fairly started, he now made
his way to Roundy, already deep in his labors of examining
the telephone.</p>

<p>"I can't see anything wrong here," Roundy grunted,
squinting at the wire coiled in the box. He tested the
poles of the battery with a wet finger. "Plenty of
juice in that. Everything tightly connected, and transmitter
and receiver in good shape."</p>

<p>Bunny flung open the nearest window.</p>

<p>"Find anything wrong, Bi?"</p>

<p>"Nothing here. How about you, Specs?"</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet on this tree."</p>

<p>Down the line the Scouts reported, each to the
effect that his wire and insulator were in prime condition.
From the last tree, Prissler shouted a confident,
"O. K. here."</p>

<p>Puzzled and disappointed, Bunny turned again to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Roundy, who was making a last effort to call Central.
Almost two minutes had passed in this determination
to live up to the Scout law that says a Scout must be
helpful and prepared at all times to give aid to those
in need. If they hoped to catch the train&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Bi!" It was the voice of Bonfire Cree calling
from the fourth tree, that roused Bunny from his slump
of depression. "Look back where the wire leaves the
house. It doesn't come out from the corner; it turns
through that vine. Take a look at the vine."</p>

<p>With a shout, Bi swung from the lowest limb of his
perch, and ran to the spot Bonfire had pointed out.
Along the side of the house, a vine had wrapped its
heavy creepers around a little segment of the wire between
the insulator on the corner and the holes where
the wire turned in to connect with the instrument.</p>

<p>Slapping open his knife, Bi slashed away the green
foliage, to expose a tiny patch of wire, hard against
a tin rain trough, where faulty insulation had rubbed
or rotted free, forming a short circuit. By bending
out the copper strands, the trouble was eliminated.</p>

<p>At that moment, a smile creased Roundy's cheeks
into joyous wrinkles.</p>

<p>"Listen to this!" he said, handing the receiver to
Bunny.</p>

<p>Faintly, but distinctly, the patrol leader could hear
the voice of Central. "Number, please?"</p>

<p>"Get 'em together, Roundy, and have Bi start on
a slow jog and keep it up. I'll catch you. And hustle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
because we have a fighting chance yet." As Roundy
picked up his cap, Bunny turned his attention to the
telephone. "The R. A. &amp; S. station, please. No, I
don't know the number, and there isn't a book here.
But it's important."</p>

<p>A moment later, a gruff voice answered. "R. A. &amp;
S."</p>

<p>"Nine of us want to catch that 10:50 train. We
must make it. Can't you hold it sixty seconds for us?
Yes, we'll be there surely by 10:51; by 10:50, I hope.
Just sixty seconds?"</p>

<p>The answer made his heart leap. "Thank you!
Thank you! You've done us the biggest favor anybody
could!"</p>

<p>Working with all possible speed, Bunny hooked the
front of the telephone box in place, warned the old
gentleman to tape the exposed wire outside the house,
and dashed after the others, without getting more than
the first part of the thanks which were being showered
upon him.</p>

<p>Already the other boys had rounded the next bend
in the road, and it took stiff running for almost three
hundred yards to catch them.</p>

<p>"Just heard the whistle of the train," Specs confided,
as Bunny came even.</p>

<p>"We'll make it," said Bunny confidently. "Why,
we're not much behind schedule. There are over
seventy seconds of our regular time left, and they have
promised to hold the train an extra minute for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>As they trotted down the last hill, the railroad station
came into sight. Already slowing down, the train was
just pulling in.</p>

<p>"Safe at last!" Nap shouted. "I knew we could
catch it."</p>

<p>But even while they were still running, a most unexpected
thing happened.</p>

<p>The train braked to a stop. But it wasn't a real
stop. As Specs said, it seemed as though the engineer
just "hesitated." Almost before the big driving
wheels had ceased revolving, and with the nine boys
still a good two hundred yards from the track, the engine
puffed, the piston rods spun the wheels till the
friction caught, and the train, under gathering speed,
pounded out of sight.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">ON THE HANDCAR</p>

<p class="pn p2">"Waterloo!" exclaimed Nap.</p>

<p>"There's a chance yet," Bunny urged. "Maybe
she's just moving up to the switch to get on another
track."</p>

<p>"A fat chance!" said the cynical Specs. "That
other track runs to New York or San Francisco or
somewhere. No, siree, that train isn't coming back to
Harrison City again to-day."</p>

<p>As the boys watched the fading black smoke, it
grew more and more evident that Specs was right.
The train which was to have been their salvation had
gone without them.</p>

<p>Bunny shook his head stubbornly. "I don't know
how we are going to get there, but I mean to keep on
trying. Nobody is licked till he gives up, and we are
a long way from giving up. Does anybody want to
quit?"</p>

<p>The "no" that answered was not full-throated, but
it satisfied the patrol leader.</p>

<p>"All right, then; we'll take up the Scout's pace
again till we reach the station."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a few seconds past 10:49 when the boys
crossed the tracks; it still lacked a little of 10:50 when
Bunny found the young man in charge of the station
puttering over a trunk in the baggage room.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're the one who telephoned about that
train?" he said, smiling pleasantly. "Well, she left
ahead of time; there's no doubt about that. I don't
know why she did any more than you do. She came
puffing in, and Mr. Gillen&mdash;he's the station master
here&mdash;hopped on board to speak to the conductor, and
the train carried him off, too. Never left before like
that, and I don't understand it. Nobody told me a
word about it."</p>

<p>"Where's the next stop?"</p>

<p>"Wells Junction. That's just three miles away.
They wait there till 11:05 to make connections with
the B. &amp; X."</p>

<p>"Three miles." Bunny did a little mental arithmetic.
"Why, we could catch it there, then, if we
just had some way of getting there."</p>

<p>The young man became interested. "Did you say
there were nine of you? Well, here's a hand car that
I was going to send up to the Junction sometime this
afternoon. It would be perfectly safe, because there
aren't any freights coming, and there isn't another
passenger due till midnight. Let's see. You want to
go to Deerfield, where you take the 'bus for Belden.
Now, you buy tickets for Deerfield, and I will let you
take the hand car. If you miss the train for any reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
you can turn in your tickets and get your money
back."</p>

<p>To Bunny, it seemed altogether too good to be true;
but there was no time to waste rejoicing over the news.</p>

<p>"All right," commented Bi a little heavily, "but I
never thought I should have to pay for my own ticket.
Still, of course, there's no way out of it."</p>

<p>It required the greater portion of the Scouts' ready
cash to pay for the thirty-eight-mile trip to Deerfield.
Roundy had disappeared, so his ticket had to be purchased
out of the common fund; but they had barely
worked the hand car to the main track before he hove
in sight, his arms full of sandwiches and boxes of
crackers.</p>

<p>"Getting along toward dinner time," he explained,
"and nobody knows when we'll get anything to eat,
if we don't stock up when we have the chance."</p>

<p>The young man at the station gave them a parting
word of advice. "You may think the hand car works
hard at first, but after you get going it will pretty nearly
run itself. Don't waste any time, but roll 'er along as
fast as you can. Turn it over to the agent at the Junction
and tell him that Jensen sent you. By-by!"</p>

<p>The young man was right. The hand car did run
loggily at first; but with four hardy Scouts on each
handlebar, it slowly gained headway.</p>

<p>"It's not exactly an automobile," said Specs, between
strokes, "but it goes."</p>

<p>"You can't puncture the tires, either," added Jump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Somebody punctured this right forward one," suggested
S. S., as by jolt and jar the wheel proved that it
was no longer as round as it had been.</p>

<p>Nap had the solution. "Keep your eyes open, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes Bonfire, and when you see a 'Free
Air' sign we'll stop."</p>

<p>For the first time since the fire, the Black Eagles
were actually growing cheerful. They seemed no
longer chasing a will-o'-the-wisp hope; at last, they
were substantially on their way to victory. The
handles fairly flew.</p>

<p>"I guess old Professor Leland will be glad to see
us," chuckled Roundy.</p>

<p>"And I guess the Belden team won't like it so
well," observed Specs.</p>

<p>"And that party they are going to give us after the
game," Bi said, smacking his lips. "I wouldn't miss
it for anything."</p>

<p>They spun along up a little grade, through a deep
cut, and out upon a high trestle.</p>

<p>"If we were inside the car of a train," Bunny said,
"we wouldn't notice a little thing like this." He
looked down at a cottage nestling upon the slope below.
"I hope there's somebody there with a blanket to catch
us if we go over the edge."</p>

<p>"Somebody on the path at this side," called Bonfire.
"It's a railroad man, too."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Is he wearing overalls and
carrying an oil can?"<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">"No, he has on a blue uniform. Might be a conductor;
or he may work around a station, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Raspingly and distinctly above the clatter-clatter of
the hand car, a voice shouted from below.</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>"He's calling to us."</p>

<p>"Let him call. Maybe he's just making a speech
to the trestle." Thus Specs.</p>

<p>"Stop that hand car!"</p>

<p>They had already spanned the tiny bridge and were
upon the solid track beyond. Just ahead, the rails
curved around a steep bank.</p>

<p>"Let him yell," said Bi defiantly. "He hasn't any
way of stopping us, has he? Probably thinks we are
stealing this old pushcart. Well, we aren't."</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with it, anyhow?" spluttered
Nap, plunging harder than ever on the handle.
"We had permission to do this, and we're going to do
it, Mr. Blue Uniform or not."</p>

<p>It was Bunny who settled the matter. Throwing
his weight on the bar as it came up, and holding it back
as it swung down, he issued his orders as patrol leader.
"Everybody hold fast. We're going to stop and
find out what he wants."</p>

<p>There was a grunt of indignant protest from Specs,
but the others obeyed first and talked afterwards.</p>

<p>"Look here, Bunny," Bi objected, as the car slowed
down, "you are running this party and I'm not; so
what you say goes. But I don't see any use of stopping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
We aren't doing anything wrong. We've
been given permission to operate the car. He hasn't
any right to tell us we can't, and if he tells us we can&mdash;why,
we know that already. There he comes now
up over the bank. I say, start up again and explain
when we get to Wells Junction."</p>

<p>Specs chimed in. "We're not going anywhere on
our own account; we're going to play baseball for the
school. All we're doing by stopping now is asking
for trouble."</p>

<p>The wheels ground to a dead center.</p>

<p>Bunny's lips were set. "I know how you feel. I
feel that way myself. But I know we can't do that
sort of thing. This man isn't a section hand: he's
wearing a uniform; he has a cap; it looks as if he had
some right to tell us to stop. I'll put it up to him just
as strong as I can, and he may let us go on. If he
won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man was within fifty yards of them, running
at a clumsy gait up the track. Though puffing and
out of wind, he did his best to shout.</p>

<p>"Take&mdash;that&mdash;hand car&mdash;off the&mdash;track!"</p>

<p>"Like fun we will!" muttered Specs.</p>

<p>The man came on, repeating his command. "Take
it off&mdash;yank it off&mdash;right away!"</p>

<p>Bunny stiffened. "I don't think you understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You young rascals stole this car. Yes, you did.
You can't tell me any different." He was with them
now; he placed protecting hands on the property of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
R. A. &amp; S. Railroad. "If you don't yank it off the
track, right on the dot, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bunny's eyes narrowed. His hands, quite without
any effort on his part, became fists. But he kept his
voice level, though it had what Specs called later "a
sort of grindstone sound."</p>

<p>"We are Boy Scouts," explained Bunny, "and we
have been given permission to use the car. We stopped
because we thought you had the right to tell us to stop;
not because we are afraid of you. We are going to
Wells Junction, and if you have nothing better to do
than call us names, Mister, we'll keep right on going
there."</p>

<p>When they talked it over afterward, everybody but
Specs agreed that the man changed his style of remarks,
not because he was afraid, but because he had begun to
understand. However this might be, his next speech
was much milder.</p>

<p>"Permission or not, you will have to yank this car
off the track; we can talk about it later."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Why! Because, if you don't, you're going to be
smashed into a million pieces. There is a big special
coming through any minute. It's on its way. Now,
get that hand car off where it won't be responsible for
an accident."</p>

<p>Though not trained section hands, the Black Eagles
came near making a record in tipping, levering and
hoisting the unwieldy hand car to a safe place along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
right of way. Once it was safely there, the man in
uniform seated himself on it and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>"I haven't had such a turn since the bad wreck in
'96. Why, when I saw you boys going lickety-split
along the track, I was ready to curl up and quit. How
did you happen to have the car, anyhow?"</p>

<p>As rapidly as possible, Bunny told him the story of
the morning's adventures, including the acquisition of
the hand car.</p>

<p>"So Jensen said that, did he? Well, he has been
working there about a week, and what he doesn't know
about railroading would fill a library. Letting a lot of
boys come up the track in a hand car! I never heard
of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Is your name Gillen?" asked Bonfire suddenly.</p>

<p>"My name's Gillen. I am the station master at
Harrison City. I am responsible for whatever happens
around here. There was something the matter with
the wires this morning, and the last half-hour every
message we received was chopped up like so much
sausage. We did not get a word about the special. I
hopped on the 11:50&mdash;it rolled in at 11:48&mdash;to find
out what they knew, and they carried me right along.
They had orders to run right through to Wells Junction
unless they had passengers waiting. They dropped
me here at the trestle, and I had just telephoned Jensen
about it when I heard you coming. Since I stopped
that hand car, I feel about ten years younger."</p>

<p>The minutes were ticking away, but there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to be done. With the news of the special on its
way, it was plain that any thought of going ahead must
be put aside until they could count on a clear track.
Already a mile had been covered, but the remaining
distance was too great to walk in the limited time left
them. No, there was nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>Mr. Gillen went to the house below, to finish his
talk over the telephone with Jensen, while the boys
fumed to no purpose. It was after eleven o'clock when
he returned, and it was almost five minutes later when
the special, with its private car, rumbled by with a
swish of dust and cinders.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, boys," said the station master, "but it
is against the rules of the road to allow any outsider
to take chances like those you were taking. If the
special had come nine minutes ago, I should have gone
on with you myself; but it's too late now even for
that."</p>

<p>Bunny looked at his watch. At that very moment,
the train which they had tried so desperately to catch
must be pulling out of Wells Junction. They had lost
their last chance of continuing their trip to Belden in
one of its coaches.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">BUSTED!</p>

<p class="pn p2">Bi broke the silence. "I'm getting mad," he said.
"It's almost as though somebody was trying to keep
us from playing that Belden game. Well, I'm going
to Belden, even if I have to walk."</p>

<p>"Walking is cheap, anyhow," sympathized Specs.
"By the way, Mr. Gillen, don't you think you might
loan us the hand car just this once, so we can get to
Deerpark&mdash;or whatever its name is?"</p>

<p>The station master laughed "You couldn't pump
it there on time if I did let you try, and I won't. But
I will tell you boys what you can do."</p>

<p>"What's that?" queried Bunny, feeling very much
as if a spark of sunshine had just shoved its way
through some particularly black clouds.</p>

<p>"Some of the farmers around here own automobiles.
Now, a motor car would get you to Belden just
as quick as going on the R. A. &amp; S. to Deerfield and
then waiting for a 'bus. Why don't you try? They
can't do any more than say 'no' to you."</p>

<p>"It's the only thing we can do now," agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," Roundy interrupted. "There's one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
other thing we can do, and that is&mdash;eat! We don't
know when we'll be ready to tuck our legs under a
table. So if nobody wants any of this truck I bought
at Harrison City, I'll take care of it myself."</p>

<p>But the Scouts, with something like an Indian war-whoop,
made it clear that they had no intention of being
left out when it came to sandwiches and sweet
crackers. Even Mr. Gillen, after some urging, ate
a handful of ginger snaps and told them the story of
the big wreck in '96. When the lunch ended, indeed,
the boys were rather sorry to part with the station
master, whose last words were a promise to let them
all ride in an engine cab the next time they reached
Harrison City.</p>

<p>"You will find the road just beyond that little hill,"
he said. "There is at least one farmhouse not more
than a half mile from here. Now, don't forget that
I am going to take you all riding on one of the R. A.
&amp; S.'s biggest engines when I see you again."</p>

<p>It was 11:25 when the boys struck the wagon road,
paralleling the track, and 11:28 when they encountered
a small boy with a fishing pole over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Was this the road to Belden? The small boy
couldn't be sure; Belden was "a awful long ways";
maybe the road ran to Belden and maybe it didn't.</p>

<p>"We'll find out soon enough," said Bunny. "How
about motor cars? Does anybody around here own
an automobile?"</p>

<p>The small boy nodded vigorously. "You see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
peddler's wagon up the road there, where the horse is
standing under the tree? Well, right on the other side
of the road, up a piece, there's Mr. Jenkins' house.
He's got an automobile&mdash;a awful big one."</p>

<p>"Does he ever rent it?"</p>

<p>"Hold on," Bi protested; "it takes real money to
rent a car, and I'll bet there isn't more than three
dollars in the crowd."</p>

<p>"We can pay for the gas and oil, anyhow, and when
we get to Belden Horace Hibbs will lend us the rest.
The question is, does he rent it?"</p>

<p>"He takes people out sometimes," admitted the
small boy.</p>

<p>"Then the next stop is Jenkins'," Bunny announced.
"Bi, you had better act as treasurer and handle the
money. Here's twenty-eight cents; that leaves me
without anything."</p>

<p>"Better say 'busted'," put in slangy Specs, "so we'll
know what you mean."</p>

<p>As they hurried down the road, the boys turned over
to Bi all the stray dimes, nickels and coppers from
their pockets, totaling altogether two dollars and one
cent.</p>

<p>"Enough to buy the car!" commented Specs.</p>

<p>"At that, we are better off than our friend, the
peddler," observed Bonfire. "Something has happened
to his right front wheel, and he doesn't seem to
know what to do."</p>

<p>"And something has happened to him," S. S. remarked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"Judging from his looks, he might have
been run through a wringer."</p>

<p>The peddler was a lean, hollow-cheeked man, whose
black moustache only made his pale face the whiter.
As the boys came up, he was squinting ruefully at the
broken wheel; its tire and splintered spokes seemed
to be almost beyond repair. But when they halted by
the side of the wagon, he turned and smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"It's busted," he said, "and the more I see of it,
the more busted it looks."</p>

<p>The boys surveyed the wheel critically.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can go on with that till you've
done business with a blacksmith," decided Bi.</p>

<p>"That's just what I think, too. It's a second-hand
wagon and about a fifth-hand horse." He patted
the animal's lean flank. "But I hoped they would
both hold together till I was fairly started. You see,
I was working in the factory over at Charles City till
a cleated belt and I came together in a clinch. After
the doctor was through patching me up, he said I
would have to stay outdoors. So I bought this outfit
and was just starting my new business when the wheel
busted."</p>

<p>"There is a good blacksmith shop back in Harrison
City," Bunny suggested. "You can prop up the
wagon and carry the wheel there on horseback."</p>

<p>The peddler nodded. "That's all right up to the
point where I have to pay for fixing the wheel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
then&mdash;" He stopped with a little laugh. "Flat
busted," he confessed. "Why, if I didn't figure that
my luck was going to change, I should go right up and
knock on the front door of the poorhouse. The
wheel's busted; I'm busted. What's more, the stuff
I have on the wagon won't sell until I get past Harrison
City, because they tell me that three peddlers have
been along here in the last week."</p>

<p>An uncomfortable silence followed, which was finally
broken by Bunny's saying awkwardly that it was
time to move on.</p>

<p>"Good luck, boys, wherever you're going!" The
peddler waved his hand in friendly farewell. "And
if you see a stray wheel rolling down the pike, I wish
you would steer it my way."</p>

<p>The patrol had gone less than one hundred yards
when Bunny broke out with an abrupt, "Wait a
minute!"</p>

<p>For some reason, the eight Scouts and the attached
Prissler were all ready and willing to stop.</p>

<p>"He can't fix that wheel."</p>

<p>"Of course, he can't."</p>

<p>"He'll have to go to some blacksmith shop."</p>

<p>"He's not any too well, either, and chances are he
has a family to support."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Nap. He repeated the word,
"Well?"</p>

<p>"It's no use," sighed Jump. "I don't want to do
it, but there's no way out. I'd feel a lot better, Bi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
if you'd take my share of the money and give it to
him."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed S. S. Without any sort of
hesitation or argument, the patrol commissioned Bi to
carry the two dollars and the one cent to the unfortunate
peddler.</p>

<p>Bi raced down the road, while the other eight jogged
slowly, awaiting his return. When he rejoined them,
he was breathless but wore a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>"What happened? What did he say?" They
were eager for the news.</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't understand at first; thought I was
trying to buy something. When he did understand,
though, that we wanted to give him the money, he
bent down and began looking at the wheel, and something
got in his eyes. I didn't wait to hear all his
story, but he told me enough to give a pretty good idea.
He has a family in Charles City, and he left every cent
with them, to keep things going. But he wouldn't
take our money as a gift; wanted to know where he
should send it when he could repay the loan. So I
gave him Bunny's name and address."</p>

<p>Specs was the first to speak. "I'm glad we helped
him out," he said, "but now we'd better think about
ourselves. What are we going to do, now that the
whole outfit's&mdash;busted?"</p>

<p>Bunny shrugged his shoulders. "It would be better
to have money, of course, but if we haven't any,
we can manage somehow without it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>They were opposite the Jenkins farm. Through
the pines, the house was visible, set far back from the
highway. Specs halted.</p>

<p>"You mean that farmer there will pay any attention
to us if we can't show him our money first?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I do mean. We are not the only
people in the world who do good turns. A lot of folks
get fun out of good turns who never heard of the Boy
Scouts."</p>

<p>Specs frowned. "And you think this farmer will
take us to Belden, when all we can do is to promise
him that we will pay him after we get there and borrow
the money?"</p>

<p>"We'll find out. We'll tell him just the fix we're
in and how we expect to get the money to pay him;
and if he is any kind of a judge of people, he will
know we are speaking the truth."</p>

<p>"He may know we're speaking the truth," said
Specs decisively, "but when you ask him to risk his
gasoline and his car, he'll say he has something else to
do. But come along; you'll see I'm right."</p>

<p>They turned into the driveway; it led to a little lawn
just in front of a white house with green blinds.</p>

<p>"There's the car," said Nap, pointing to a bulky
automobile visible through the open door of a homemade
garage.</p>

<p>"And back there is the man who owns it," said
Bonfire. "Hear that? He's behind the house, hoeing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know whether it's a man, woman or
child," answered Specs. He stooped and picked up a
stone. "I suppose if I chuck this over here, you can
tell me whether it lights on an ant hill or on a yellow
dandelion."</p>

<p>Jerking his arm, he shot the stone in the direction
of the corner of the house. From the rear, a second
later, came the crash and jingle of breaking glass.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can tell you where it lit," said Bonfire
cheerfully. "It lit on a cold frame. You sent the
stone right through it. And here comes the man I
was telling you about. If you had kept your eyes
open, you would have noticed that his coat and hat
are lying over there in the grass."</p>

<p>From behind the house, hoe in hand, stalked a tall,
big-fisted farmer, whose beetling eyebrows and
scraggly beard gave him a most forbidding appearance.</p>

<p>"Who busted that pane of glass?" he called angrily.</p>

<p>"Busted!" whispered Specs. "The peddler was
busted, the wagon was busted, we're busted, and now
the cold frame is busted. Is there anything anywhere
that isn't busted?" Aloud he said, "I did it; I threw
the stone."</p>

<p>Bunny interposed hurriedly. "It was a mistake.
We didn't know the cold frame was there."</p>

<p>"Mistake, huh?" His frown deepened. "Well,
I suppose you can pay for your mistakes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunny shook his head. "We can't pay for it now;
we haven't a cent. But the nine of us must be in
Belden by three o'clock this afternoon. If you will
take us there in your car we will see that you get paid
for the trip and for the broken glass, too."</p>

<p>The farmer stared angrily. "Is that all you have
to say?"</p>

<p>Bunny took a step forward. "No," he said mildly.
"If you don't care to take us, I will leave my watch
with you until I can send you the money for the broken
glass. It is a five-dollar watch, so you can be sure it's
worth more to me than the price of one pane of glass.
And if you will let us use your telephone, while we
try to rent an automobile somewhere, I'll be glad to
send you the money for every call."</p>

<p>It is not easy for an angry man to remain angry
when the person with whom he wishes to quarrel keeps
his temper. For a solid ten seconds the farmer
frowned; then his eyebrows raised and his balled fists
unclenched.</p>

<p>"Look here," he began awkwardly, "I'm not such
a hard man as all that. I don't want your watch.
Tell me why you are all bent on getting to Belden by
three o'clock."</p>

<p>As briefly as possible, Bunny related the misadventures
of their trip.</p>

<p>"You're a plucky lot," commented the farmer when
the boy had finished. "And I should be glad to take
you, for nothing, because I counted on driving to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Belden myself this afternoon. But I can't go, and I
can't take you, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tense and eager, the nine boys listened for the reason.</p>

<p>"&mdash;because the car is busted."</p>

<p>"Busted!" repeated Specs dolefully. "I knew it all
the time. Everybody and everything is busted!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">BORROWERS' LUCK</p>

<p class="pn p2">With something of an effort, Bunny wrenched his
gaze from the back of the disappointing automobile and
turned to Specs.</p>

<p>"No, not everybody," he said, striving hard to be
cheerful. "There's the peddler, you know; he isn't
busted any more&mdash;quite!"</p>

<p>"What peddler?" The farmer lifted an inquiring
head.</p>

<p>Everybody squirmed uncomfortably. It was the
code of the Black Eagle Patrol not to talk about the
good turns it did, because that sounded like bragging.
But the farmer was persistent. Bit by bit, with question
and guess and prompting, he pieced out the story:
how the boys had found the peddler on the road, with
his second-hand wagon that had come to grief; how
he had confessed he had no money for the necessary
repairs; how the boys, because they were Scouts and
it was their duty to do a good turn when they could,
had given him their last cent and sped him on his way
rejoicing. When the last scrap of confession had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
dragged from them, the farmer held out his hand to
Bunny.</p>

<p>"So you are the patrol leader, are you, Payton?
Well, I am glad to know a boy like you. Jenkins is
my name; Alfred Jenkins."</p>

<p>Gravely, Bunny introduced the other Scouts. "And
this is young Prissler," he concluded. "He is training
to be a tenderfoot, and just as soon as there is a vacancy
in the patrol he will be taken in."</p>

<p>"So?" Mr. Jenkins nodded understandingly. He
scratched at his beard. "I reckon," he added, "you
get a lot of satisfaction doing good turns like that.
By ginger, I'd like to have that feeling myself. If
the old 'bus would only run&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" demanded the practical
Specs.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins spread his hands helplessly. "I wish
I knew. But I'm no mechanic. She's just dead;
dead on her feet, you might say. Won't go. Won't
even start."</p>

<p>"Gas line clogged, maybe."</p>

<p>"Loose connections."</p>

<p>"Carburetor float stuck."</p>

<p>"Magneto points burned off."</p>

<p>The farmer's eyes kindled before this volley of suggestions.
"Say," he exclaimed, "do you boys know
anything about a car?"</p>

<p>"A little," Bunny nodded. "Specs here is trying
for a merit badge for automobiling, and we all got sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of interested in his studying. You have to know a
good deal about a car to get that badge."</p>

<p>"Well, say!" Mr. Jenkins was as eager as a youngster.
"Say, let's trundle her out here and look her
over. You might find out what's wrong."</p>

<p>Because Specs had honestly devoted a great deal of
his spare time to his ambition of qualifying for a merit
badge in automobiling, Bunny put him in charge. It
was no trick at all, of course, to release the brake and
roll the car out of the homemade garage. Once in the
open, Specs hopped into the front seat.</p>

<p>"No, that self-starter hasn't worked for a long
time," Mr. Jenkins confessed, as the Scout pressed
a tentative foot against it and cocked his ear expectantly
for the hum of the motor. "Batteries dead, I
'spose. You'll have to crank her."</p>

<p>"All right, Bi!" called Specs; "you're the boy to
wind her up."</p>

<p>Bi grimaced. He might need his good right arm
for pitching that afternoon. But at a nod from Bunny,
he sprang readily enough to the crank. Unless the
car started, it looked like there wouldn't be any baseball
game to play.</p>

<p>Balancing the crank once or twice against the compression,
he lifted it suddenly and spun it with all his
might. But no explosion signaled the success of his
effort. Bi straightened up to catch his breath and
wipe off the perspiration that was trickling down his
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try her again," Specs ordered. "I'll work the
spark when you get going."</p>

<p>Bi bent to his task for the second time. Round and
round whirled the crank. But, as before, the motor
refused to "catch."</p>

<p>"Prime her," suggested Bonfire.</p>

<p>Once more Bi cranked till he was ready to drop. In
the meantime, Bonfire began prowling about and muttering
to himself: "Tank full. Gas flows all right.
Carburetor float not stuck. Must be the ignition."
He tested with a long-bladed screwdriver. "Yep; no
spark. Sure you've&mdash;Hello! Why, you muckle-headed
McGrew, do you expect to get a merit badge
for trying to start a motor without throwing on the
switch?"</p>

<p>"What!" Bi threw himself on the ground and
kicked feebly. "Do you mean to say I've been cranking
my head off when you didn't even throw over the
switch? Help!"</p>

<p>Specs grinned sheepishly. "I thought you needed
the exercise," he said. "All right; she'll start now."</p>

<p>But she wouldn't. Bi cranked till he was red in the
face, without the reward of even one feeble puff from
the exhaust. With a last spin of the handle, for good
measure, he stepped back disgustedly.</p>

<p>"If anybody else thinks he can twist her tail any
better than that," he announced, "let him step up and
try. I'm through; postilutely through."</p>

<p>By this time, even Specs was ready to admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the motor was "busted." "It's the ignition," he explained.
"As soon as we find out why she doesn't
get a spark, we can fix her in a jiffy."</p>

<p>But discovering the nub of the trouble proved no easy
job. The spark plugs were taken out; all connections
were examined; each wire was traced to coil and magneto;
the magneto itself came in for critical inspection.
But no break or short circuit revealed itself. Already,
the first glowing enthusiasm of the boys was blowing
cold and dead.</p>

<p>Bonfire snapped the switch backward and forward.
"Feels loose," he said. "Let me have that screwdriver,
Specs." With deft hands, he removed the face
of the switch-box. "Here's the little nigger in the
woodpile, fellows!" he called exultingly. "See, those
loose nuts allow the contact plate to drop down. The
circuit is not completed even when you throw on the
switch. No wonder she won't run!" He twirled the
nuts with his fingers and clamped them tight with a
wrench. "Now try her."</p>

<p>"Not me!" jeered Bi. "I've cranked her from
here to Belden already. Let somebody else crank her
home again." But even while he talked, he was walking
toward the front of the car. Roundy reached for
the swinging handle, only to be pushed aside by Bi.
With scarcely an effort, the strongest Scout in the
patrol turned her over again&mdash;and the motor sprang
into life with a roar.</p>

<p>"Throttle her down!" Bi shouted to Specs. "Wake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
up there! Don't let her race! If ever you win a merit
badge for automobiling, I'll eat it for breakfast. Isn't
he rotten, Mr. Jenkins?"</p>

<p>The farmer smiled. "Oh, he'll pass, I reckon.
Now, let me see. Five of you on the back seat, two on
the collapsible chairs&mdash;that's seven&mdash;and two of you
on the front seat here with me. Wait just a minute
till I get my coat and tell my wife I'm going, and
we'll start."</p>

<p>"With any kind of luck at all," Bunny promised
happily, looking at his watch, "we should be at the
Belden ball park a little after one o'clock. It's 11:42
right now, and we have about thirty-seven miles to
cover."</p>

<p>Specs held up his hand. "I've got my fingers
crossed," he said. "Don't forget all the things that
have happened to us so far to-day. Touch wood when
you say that, Bunny."</p>

<p>But luck seemed at last to be roosting with the Black
Eagle Patrol. Once out upon the main highway, the
motor settled down to a contented purr, with never a
miss or hint of trouble, and the big car rolled placidly
toward Belden, piling the miles behind it quite as if it
were shod with seven-league boots instead of rubber
tires. Mr. Jenkins admitted that he was "no great
shucks at driving", but he more than made up for any
lack of technical skill by his careful and common-sense
handling of wheel and accelerator. An hour before,
Belden had seemed to the Scouts some far spot on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
rim of the world; now, as everybody felt, it lay just
over the hill.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the boys enjoyed the ride.
More than once, they had watched enviously as Royal
Sheffield dashed into Lakeville with his trim roadster;
more than once, too, if the truth be known, they had
lingered hungrily as he backed it out of Grady's barn
after school and made ready for the homeward trip.
But Sheffield lived in Charlesboro, and his motoring
was done largely in the roads about that village. True,
the Sefton automobile never had a vacant seat when
any boy could be found to fit it; but Mr. Sefton used
the car for business, and it was also frequently out of
town. This was different, too; this was a cross-country
jaunt, over unfamiliar roads, mile upon mile, with
every turn and rise revealing new wonders.</p>

<p>"Like it?" asked Mr. Jenkins, without turning his
head.</p>

<p>There was no adequate way of expressing their
gratitude and pleasure, but the farmer seemed well content
with Specs' explosive, "You bet we do!" It was
curious about Mr. Jenkins. He owned the car, and he
must have ridden thousands of miles in it; yet he
seemed to be getting just as much fun out of this trip
as any of his guests. "Haven't felt so young in thirty
years," he said once, with a chuckle, as he swung wide
to avoid a bump.</p>

<p>On and on sang the car: uphill, biting on second
speed; across a bit of tableland, feeling its oats on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
high; down a long incline, pulsing with such eagerness
that it had to be restrained; through wood roads,
bowered with cool, overhanging trees; into the bright
sunshine again; past farmhouses, with barking dogs
and waving people; over long stretches of concrete, that
gave back never a jounce or jolt; through sleepy little
villages, waking and nodding a single welcome and
good-by in one; out into the country once more, between
green fields of sprouting corn and wheat; and on
and on, motor humming drowsily and rubber-tired
wheels crisping their chorus. It was good just to be
outdoors on such a day in June.</p>

<p>They climbed a long, winding hill. At the top was
a little cottage, bordered by a trim lawn, which was
splashed here and there with gay flower plots. In the
background loomed a barn, more than twice the size
of the house, with a silo at one side and a windmill
just beyond. Mr. Jenkins squinted meditatively from
the spout of his radiator, steaming a bit, to the windmill.</p>

<p>"Reckon we'd better stop for water," he announced.</p>

<p>A gray, bent wisp of a man answered his knock on
the door and listened gravely to his request for the
loan of a pail. He seemed to be looking, not at Mr.
Jenkins, but through him, as if he were only vaguely
aware of the other's presence. But he said, "Oh, yes,"
and brought the pail.</p>

<p>It took only a minute to fill the radiator. Mr. Jenkins
began to screw on the cap, while the boys piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
back into the car. Bunny picked up the pail and carried
it to the house. As he lifted his hand to knock on the
door, he heard something that made him hesitate.</p>

<p>Inside the house, a woman was crying softly, and a
man's voice was soothing, over and over, "Now, Ma!
Now, Ma! Don't take on so! It can't be helped!
Now, Ma! Now, Ma!"</p>

<p>After a moment of indecision, Bunny rapped. The
sobbing stopped. Footsteps approached the door, and
presently it was opened, a little hesitatingly, by the man
from whom Mr. Jenkins had borrowed the pail. Bunny
extended it to him, with a word of thanks. He had
meant to turn away at once, but something seemed to
hold him.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is anything wrong there?" he asked, jerking
his thumb toward the darkened room within.</p>

<p>"It's just Ma," the little man told him. He spoke
meekly, almost apologetically, but his high-pitched
voice carried clearly to the other boys. "She's all
broke up over not seein' John."</p>

<p>"John?" Bunny put a question in the word; then,
when it brought no reply, he added, at a hazard, "He's
your son, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, John's our boy. He's a good boy, John is.
But he's been away a long time, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he coming home?"</p>

<p>The man raised his hand as if to ward off a blow.
"No," he said in a wavering voice. "He's going
away, mebbe for years; going away to China. He's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
an engineer, John is; works for a big construction company
in New York City. This spring he wrote that he
would come home to visit Ma and me. So we tidied
up all about for him." The little man waved an expressive
hand, and Bunny understood, all at once, why
the grass was so neatly cropped, and why the flowers
studded the lawn, and why the pathway to the door was
made of clean, white pebbles. It had all been done for
their son. "But to-day we got a telegram&mdash;delayed,
they said over the 'phone. He can't come. He's
ordered to China, right away, to help build a new
railroad. His boat leaves San Francisco on the sixth,
and he can't even stop on his way across the country.
But he said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Bunny encouraged.</p>

<p>"He wired to meet his train at Middletown on the
third&mdash;that's to-day. It stops there twenty minutes.
But the telegram just came, and we haven't any way
of getting there. That's why Ma is all broke up.
She won't see him for years more, mebbe."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bunny. A queer, numb feeling seemed
to be gripping him. "How far is Middletown?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen mile; nearer nineteen, mebbe."</p>

<p>"And Belden?" Perhaps Mr. Jenkins could come
back.</p>

<p>"Nine mile and a half."</p>

<p>"When does that train get to Middletown?"</p>

<p>"Goin' on two o'clock, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bunny again. He looked at his watch:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
12:51. No, even if Mr. Jenkins were willing, it would
be out of the question for him to come back to
Laurel in time to take the old couple to Middletown.
There was just one way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The man's wistful eyes were staring again, looking
straight through him, just as they had been when he
answered Mr. Jenkins' knock. Bunny understood now
what they were straining to see. It was another boy,
this little man's boy, bound for a foreign country. And
inside the house, striving bravely to stifle her sobs, was
the mother.</p>

<p>Bunny made up his own mind quickly enough. He
knew what he wanted to do. But there were the other
fellows to consider. They wouldn't agree to his plan;
no, not in a thousand years. They had a right to&mdash;</p>

<p>Behind him, he caught the murmur of a low question
and answer. Then a voice called, "Oh, Bunny!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" He turned to the car. Save for Mr. Jenkins,
it was quite empty. All the boys had climbed
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jenkins will take them to Middletown." It
was Bi speaking. "He says he will be glad to do it.
Tell her to hurry."</p>

<p>Bunny's heart gave a glad leap. It wasn't wholly
because of the sacrifice they were all making, although
that counted, of course, but because of the way in
which they had decided the matter, unanimously and
without a single objection. He wondered if anywhere
else in the world there were fellows like that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," he said, fighting hard to keep the catch
out of his voice. Then to the man in the doorway:
"Mr. Jenkins will take you and your wife to Middletown,
sir, so you can see your boy. Oh, no, we'll be
glad to stretch our legs and walk a bit. That's nothing.
Good-by, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said the little man. His eyes were
shining now. He held out a trembling hand. "Good-by
and God bless you!"</p>

<p>And with this benediction ringing in their ears, the
nine boys waved to Mr. Jenkins, who was fussing with
something on the dash, and began the hike down the
long hill toward the wooded valley at the bottom.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">ONE CAR AND THREE COWS</p>

<p class="pn p2">The young man looked worried. He was capless
and coatless, and the sleeves of his shirt were rolled to
the elbows. When he saw the nine boys approaching,
he stopped and waited for them.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you," said Specs, "that's George W.
Trouble's youngest son. About half the world seems to
be needing help to-day. Shall we walk right past
without seeing him?"</p>

<p>"Shall we?" asked Bonfire slyly. "We can pretend,
of course, that we don't notice his car, on ahead
a bit."</p>

<p>"Whose car? Where? How do you know?"
Specs was twisting his head and straining his eyes for
some glimpse of an automobile. "What makes you
think he has a car?"</p>

<p>Bonfire grinned. "Well, maybe he carries those
goggles in his shirt pocket just to look like a driver,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anybody could guess after seeing them," sniffed
Specs, unimpressed. He caught the snicker that was
going around the patrol. "Oh, all right! All right!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Maybe I did overlook 'em. If you're so smart, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, tell me where the car is and why he
isn't riding in it."</p>

<p>Bonfire bowed mockingly. "Certainly. The car is
down there in the hollow, off to one side of the road.
It is stuck in the mud. The man has tried chains on
the rear wheels, but it won't pull itself free, even with
them. He wants us to give him a lift."</p>

<p>"Rats!" said Specs. He dismissed the statements
as careless banter. "But if that fellow has a car able
to run to Belden, and needs something like a loose
switch tightened&mdash;" A heavy wink completed the
sentence.</p>

<p>Bunny frowned. There were times when Specs
simply could not and would not remember the Scout
law about taking pay for good turns. But it was too
late to thresh out the question with him. By this
time, they were abreast the young man.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, fellows!" he said to them. "I'm
in a bit of a mess, with my car stuck in the mud there
in the hollow. I swerved off the road, to avoid running
down a dog, and plumped into the soft creek-bed.
She won't pull out, even with chains."</p>

<p>Bunny nodded his willingness to help. He was
afraid Specs would blurt out something about pushing
out the car in return for a ride to Belden but he need
not have worried. Specs was wholly beyond speech.
The absolute confirmation of Bonfire's guesses, detail
by detail, had left him stunned and dumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say," he gasped to that Scout, as they turned to
follow the young man to a point where the road dipped
into a broad gulley, "how did you figure it all out,
anyhow? What did you see that made you know about
the mired car?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," smiled Bonfire good-naturedly. "I
didn't see a thing except the goggles; they connected
the man with a car. But I did use my ears. Halfway
down the hill, when everybody was pretty glum and not
saying much, I heard a motor racing, then the clutch
thrown in, then a sort of churning, with the motor
slowing till it almost stalled. Once or twice it did.
So I knew a car was stuck. It was off the road a ways,
of course, because this is a state highway, with a rock
bottom. And the only place a car would mire is in
some low hollow, where the sun never has a chance to
shine through the trees and dry the mud. That's all."</p>

<p>"But you said the car had chains on."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the chains. I did use my eyes there. It
was the mud on the man's shirt sleeves, where he
reached around the tires putting them on, that told me
he had tried chains. Anything else you want to
know?"</p>

<p>"What color are his grandmother's eyes?" Specs
demanded fiercely. "Tell me that, you bunk detective.
What's his sister's middle name? What make of car
is it?"</p>

<p>"Saybrook touring," answered Bonfire, picking up
the last question. When Specs, completely dazed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
this new flash of information, looked up with awestruck
eyes, the other Scout pointed a gleeful finger
at the car beside the road. "All you have to do, my
boy, is to keep your eyes and ears open. Come on;
Bunny's calling."</p>

<p>Getting the car out of the mud was neither a long nor
a difficult job. All it required was a little knowledge
and common sense. The wheels had evidently sunk a
few inches at the outset, and their useless whirling had
furrowed a nasty rut, made deeper by the use of chains.
But when the boys had helped jack up the rear end and
filled the holes with branches, against which the chains
could bite, and had made a path of the same material
to the solid road, the car pulled itself clear without any
trouble at all.</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man, wiping his forehead,
"I might have done all that by myself. Just the same,
I'm much obliged." He drew a purse from his pocket.
"How much do I owe you?"</p>

<p>The "busted" patrol gasped. It was as if they
feared their leader might falter before this temptation.
But Bunny waved back the bill the young man was offering.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he said. "We are Boy Scouts,
and we are not allowed to take pay for doing good
turns."</p>

<p>"But if you are going to Belden&mdash;" Specs began
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not," said the young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are," Specs persisted, "or if you could go
there, we'd like to be taken along."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not," said the young man again, "and
I can't." He said it very decisively. "I'm much
obliged for your help, but I can't pay for it&mdash;that
way." He smiled a little derisively, stepped on the
self-starter, and shot the car at the long hill down which
the boys had just come.</p>

<p>"I hope he gets stuck again," snorted Specs, looking
at the swirl of dust that marked the young man's going.
"I hope he breaks a steering knuckle and six
spokes, and has nineteen punctures."</p>

<p>"No, you don't, either," Bunny put in. "You're
wrong and he's right. Do you realize, Specs, that
this is the first time in all our trip we have given a
wrong impression of the Boy Scouts? That man
thinks we did him a good turn in the hope of a reward;
he'll think we always want some kind of pay when we
help somebody out. Well, we don't; and what's more,
we're going to stop making people think we do."</p>

<p>In the face of this gentle reproof, Specs had nothing
to say. When they resumed their hike, he fell in at
the rear and seemed to be pondering the matter. Opposite
the next farmhouse, he drew up to the patrol
leader and said, in a nonchalant way. "All right,
Bunny; I'm cured." Then, to prove it, he raced into
the yard and pumped a trough full of water for an old
lady, and raced out again to the Scouts before she had
time to thank him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>With this minor worry off his mind, Bunny faced
the greater problem of getting to Belden in time for the
ball game.</p>

<p>"It's a good nine miles yet," he told the others,
"and we have less than two hours to make it. At the
Scout pace, we might possibly cover the distance in
time, but it would leave us all played out. I guess
we'll have to turn in somewhere and&mdash;and find
another Mr. Jenkins."</p>

<p>They were in the lowlands now. The road stretched
ahead, as far as the eye could reach, between lush fields
of corn and wheat and oats. Grimly, without talking,
the boys plodded on, pressing ahead as steadily as if
Belden were just around the next corner. But it
wasn't, of course, and something had to be done to
revive their drooping spirits. At the worst, a halt at
some house would serve to break the monotony of
the hike.</p>

<p>Bunny chose a prosperous looking place on the right.
The house was big and freshly painted. The barns and
granaries were in good repair. Up-to-date farm implements
nearly filled the yard. Everywhere was an
air of success.</p>

<p>A shaggy shepherd dog ran to meet them, barking
uncertainly and wagging its tail, as if divided between
a desire to be courteous and yet to serve its master at
the same time. Bunny called to the animal, and it came
close and sniffed at his legs, and was satisfied. He
hoped its owner would prove as friendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he knocked at the door, there were no
answering footsteps. He knocked again. A third
time. Convinced at last that they were merely wasting
precious time, he turned to the others with a little
gesture of disappointment.</p>

<p>"There's nobody home," he said.</p>

<p>"I can tell you something else," added Bonfire.
"The man who lives here doesn't own an automobile;
there's no garage. And he has only two horse stalls
in that big barn, both empty. Even if he wanted to
help us get to Laurel, he couldn't."</p>

<p>Bunny nodded gloomily. "We might as well hike
on."</p>

<p>Fifty yards down the road, Bonfire lifted a pointing
hand.</p>

<p>"Look there!" he shouted. "Three cows in that
cornfield, gobbling up those little stalks as if they were
prairie grass. I don't believe&mdash;Ah, I thought so!
See that gap in the fence on the far side. They have
broken in."</p>

<p>"And nobody around to chase them out," said
Specs briskly. "I guess it's a job for us."</p>

<p>"What good would it do us?" Bunny tested him.
"There isn't a soul about to thank us or to give us a
lift on our way."</p>

<p>Specs hung his head. "Aw, Bunny!" he protested;
"forget it, won't you?"</p>

<p>And then everybody laughed, as if it were a great
joke, and finally Specs laughed, too. After that, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
was no question about what they meant to do. Nine
boys climbed through the barbed-wire fence along the
road and went whooping toward the astonished trio of
cows. Tender and juicy as the cornstalks were, the
animals realized that their stolen meal must end. They
turned and galloped awkwardly through the gap in the
fence, back into their own field.</p>

<p>"Sorry, old girls!" shouted Specs, quite himself
again, "but you can't eat up a crop just for the sake of
one square meal. Besides, you'd get an awful, awful
tummy-ache."</p>

<p>"Now let's patch up the break," urged Bunny.
"We can prop up this broken post and restring these
wires. It won't take ten minutes."</p>

<p>In something like half that time, the fence was as
good as new for all practical purposes. While they
were winding the last loose strand about the bolstered
post, a voice from the cornfield said pleasantly:</p>

<p>"When the boss's away, the cows will play. Thank
you, boys; thank you!"</p>

<p>The minute Bunny looked at the man, he knew
he was going to like him. He stood just beyond the
dividing fence, his lean, brown face crinkling into an
irresistible smile.</p>

<p>"Are those your cows, sir?" Bunny asked.</p>

<p>"I own them," the man admitted, "and I still own
the sprouting corn in this field&mdash;thanks to you boys.
I came up the road just in time to see what you did for
me. But I am curious to learn how you happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
be passing, and why you stopped to save my crop from
serious damage. Suppose we all adjourn to my house
yonder, where we can talk things over. There is a
crock of cold milk there, and a jar of cookies and
doughnuts. If you will do me the honor&mdash;" He
broke short the sentence with another of his big, fine
smiles, and turned to lead the way. The Scouts fell in
behind him.</p>

<p>Over the doughnuts and milk, Bunny fell ready victim
to the stranger's warming personality; and somehow,
without being able to tell exactly how the conversation
started, he was revealing the troubles of the
Black Eagle Patrol in getting to the baseball game at
Belden, and explaining the mishaps it had encountered.
Bonfire's previous assurance that there were no cars
or horses on the place made it easier. The man
couldn't possibly misunderstand.</p>

<p>Nor did he. He knew all about Boy Scouts and good
turns without hope of reward, and he nodded and
smiled and said, "Exactly!" when Specs remarked
that they knew he hadn't any means of taking them to
Belden.</p>

<p>"And I am afraid," the man added, "there isn't a
thing on wheels or four legs in this country that hasn't
trundled or trotted to the farmers' institute at Middletown
this afternoon. That's where my own team
went, and I do not own an automobile." He looked
quizzically at the boys. "You are ready to admit, I
suppose, that you have come to the point in your trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
where, if it were a story, the author would write 'The
End.' It isn't even 'To Be Continued.'"</p>

<p>"But it is, sir," Bunny denied sturdily. "We're
going on to Belden. I know we can't make it afoot in
time now; but even if we reach the ball park during
the ninth inning, and even if we get there so tired we
can hardly move, we're going to make it. We&mdash;we
aren't quitters, I guess."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the man. "I like that spirit. It
moves mountains and&mdash;hearts." He walked to the
window and stared toward a distant field. "Then you
boys could not help me on the farm this afternoon, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No," Bunny confessed reluctantly, "I'm afraid
not."</p>

<p>"I did not expect you could," the man said, with his
understanding smile. "Anyhow, my machinery needs
overhauling by some expert."</p>

<p>The nine boys smiled back. A Scout must be cheerful.
But it was hard to smile, very hard, with the
clock on the wall striking half past one and Belden
nine miles away.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">LOST: ONE BASEBALL TEAM</p>

<p class="pn p2">In choice seats of the Belden bleachers, opposite first
base, sat two men and one girl. Anybody with half
an eye could see that the girl was in charge of the
party. For instance, every time the gathering fans in
the stands chorused the staccato Belden High School
yell, she sprang up, like a cheer leader, with her black
eyes snapping, and said: "Right back at them now!
We'll show them! Ready! One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"
And Mr. Sefton and Mr. Hibbs and Molly Sefton
roared defiantly:</p>

<p class="pp1">"U Rah! U Rah!<br />
U Rah! Yi!</p>
<p class="pp2">Lakeville! Lakeville!<br />
Lakeville High!"</p>

<p>Out on the diamond, the Belden team practiced in
a desultory fashion, keeping one eye on the ball and
the other on the gate of the park&mdash;which, it may be
remarked in passing, was all right so far as the gate
was concerned, but not particularly helpful in batting,
throwing, or catching. In fact, the nine was displaying
a brand of baseball that would have shamed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
bunch of kindergartners; and the boys knew it and
were consequently irritated. But the fault was not
wholly theirs.</p>

<p>The trouble was that even at two-thirty with the
stands rapidly filling, with the Belden team warming
up, and with the umpire waiting patiently and pretending
not to see or hear anything that was going on (as
all good umpires must pretend before they slip on
their chest protectors and fill the pockets of their
navy-blue serge coats with balls and go out behind the
pitcher and raise their right hands and yell, "Pla-a-ay
ba-a-al!")&mdash;with everything and everybody apparently
ready for the game that was scheduled to begin
half an hour later, the opposing Lakeville players had
not yet arrived.</p>

<p>"But they'll come," declared Molly Sefton for the
hundredth time. "If they don't"&mdash;she stamped her
foot angrily&mdash;"if they don't come, why&mdash;why,
we'll just go out there and play that Belden team ourselves."
Whereat the portly Mr. Sefton and the gray-haired
Mr. Hibbs winced perceptibly.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said the Scout Master of the
Black Eagle Patrol, also for the hundredth time.
"The train should have arrived long ago."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snapped Mr. Sefton, speaking as if it
were a lesson he was learning by heart. "It's late,
that's all. Nothing to worry about. Give them
time."</p>

<p>Molly saw the man first. He was shouldering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
way up the rows of seats from the ground toward
them, and he was doing it with an officiousness that
marked him as a person of importance. He wore a
black suit, almost ministerial in cut, a stiff white shirt,
and a black bow tie of the sort that is put on by tucking
two stiff ends underneath the flaps of a turn-down
collar.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, halting before the two Lakeville
men and ignoring Miss Molly altogether, "where
is your baseball team?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sefton held him eye to eye. "It's coming," he
announced confidently.</p>

<p>"Are you the Belden coach?" Horace Hibbs asked
mildly.</p>

<p>"No, gentlemen, I am not the coach. I am, you
might say, the man behind the team. Throughout the
season, I have been its supporter, its mainstay, its benefactor.
Allow me to offer an illustration of what I
mean. Do you see that flagstaff?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I contributed that. When Belden has won this
game, I shall run up the pennant with my own hands,
and I shall, at the request of my friends, say&mdash;ahem,
a few words of congratulation to the team and the
assembled crowd."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" remarked Mr. Sefton, without any great
show of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"But I am digressing," the great one stated. "I
came here to warn you gentlemen that if, on the stroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of three o'clock, the Lakeville team is still missing,
I shall instruct the umpire to forfeit the game by the
usual score of nine to nothing. Immediately, I shall
award the pennant to Belden and begin&mdash;ahem, my
speech. I thank you, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"For what?" gasped Mr. Sefton, watching the man
push his way to the bottom of the stand. "Look here,
Horace, they can't do that, can they?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hibbs shook a worried head. "I don't know,"
he confessed. "In golf or tennis, of course, if a
player does not report, he forfeits his contest. And
there is a baseball rule to the effect that if a team refuses
to play&mdash;"</p>

<p>A boy stalked along the ground at the foot of the
bleachers. He was waving a paper and shouting:
"Horace Hibbs! Message for Horace Hibbs! Horace
Hibbs! Message for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Up here, boy!" Molly sprang to her feet, waving
wildly. "Right up here!&mdash;Let him pass, <i>please</i>!
Thank <i>you</i>!&mdash;This is Mr. Hibbs&mdash;Quick! What is
it?"</p>

<p>With nervous haste, Horace Hibbs unfolded the
paper. The message was scrawled in a free, running
hand, with several erasures, as if it had been taken
over a telephone. He read it to the other two:</p>

<p class="pq1 p1">Tell Horace Hibbs, Belden High School baseball
park, that Lakeville team has been delayed by bad
freight wreck on railroad ahead. May be very late in
arriving. Hold game.&mdash;Leland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"Oh!" gasped Molly. It was as if somebody had
struck her a stinging blow on the cheek. She felt the
pain, the mental despair, and then, as the numbness
passed, a tingling anger and unreasoning spleen
against the world in general. "Oh!" she said again,
crimsoning. "They are in trouble. It isn't fair.
Why don't you men do something? Dad, how can
you sit quietly when the boys need help?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sefton took the message from Horace Hibbs
and smoothed it upon his knee. "H'm! No time
mentioned; no name of the place where they are
stranded. But they will know at the Belden station.
I will get in touch with the team by telephone; then
we will see what can be done." And with a final
admonition not to worry, he was gone.</p>

<p>With troubled eyes, Molly Sefton and Horace Hibbs
followed his course across the park. Once, near the
ball players on the diamond, he seemed to hesitate,
as if to offer them some explanation; then, with a
shrug of his shoulders, he marched on without stopping.
Again, near home plate, he turned his head at
the call of the pompous man who meant to award the
pennant to Belden. Even from where they sat, the
girl and the Scout Master could see Mr. Sefton smile
and nod confidently. He believed the Lakeville team
would yet arrive safely, and he meant to make the
important person believe it, too.</p>

<p>"Good old Dad!" beamed Molly. She squirmed
sideways on her seat. "Talk to me, Horace Hibbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Tell me the team will come. Tell me it will be here
in time. It must, you know; it just must!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Horace Hibbs simply, "it will
come." There was something so earnest in the boyish
way he said it, and in the plausible reasons he gave
later for expecting the missing team, that Molly felt
her courage warming again. The twin worried lines
from the top of her nose to the middle of her forehead
ironed out; the corners of her mouth quirked into
the forerunner of an honest smile.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, the minutes had been
ticking away. It was a quarter of three now. Up
and down the stands, impatient fans, who could not
understand why the Lakeville nine did not take the
field for practice, were shuffling their feet uneasily, and
calling, "Play ball! Play ball!"</p>

<p>The messenger came a second time. He knew now
where to find Horace Hibbs, and he was holding out
the scribbled paper before either Molly or the Scout
Master saw him. It read:</p>

<p class="pq1 p1">We are leaving to walk around wreck to Elkana,
where conductor tells us they may start another train
for Belden, to take place of one held up by blocked
track.&mdash;Leland.</p>

<p class="p1">"Wait!" Molly called to the boy as he was turning
away. "Where did you get this?"</p>

<p>"Long-distance telephone to the grand-stand over
there."</p>

<p>Molly dismissed him with a wave of her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
"Then Dad won't know where to reach the team," she
said, puckering her mouth as she thought rapidly.
"You must find him here at the station, Horace Hibbs,
and tell him to call up Elkana. Run along. Don't
waste a minute. If they are really coming, I will
keep this game from starting till they get here."</p>

<p>Obediently, the man rose. Whatever doubts he may
have entertained as to her ability to handle the situation
at the ball park vanished before the determination
expressed by her pursed lips and clenched fists. She
was competent, Horace told himself; yes, as competent
as any Scout in the Black Eagle Patrol.</p>

<p>With both her father and Horace Hibbs gone, Molly
realized that she was now the single Lakeville representative
in all that crowd. The thought sent little
prickles down her rigid back, and she caught herself
plucking nervously at her skirt. The discovery
wounded her pride.</p>

<p>"Now, Molly Sefton," she admonished herself severely,
clasping the errant hands in her lap, "don't be
a good-for-nothing, sniveling little coward!"</p>

<p>More time passed. More fans stamped their feet
and yelled, "Play ball!" The important person who
was going to have the umpire forfeit the game strutted
to the bottom of the rows of seats. There, watch in
hand, he looked up near-sightedly, without discovering
that two thirds of his former audience had disappeared,
and said, in a voice like fate, "Five minutes
more, gentlemen; five minutes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly was having a good deal of trouble keeping
herself in leash. She wavered between a desire to
shriek at the top of her voice and another to get out
the little lace-fringed handkerchief Aunt Ella had
given her, and have a good cry. It took courage to
fight back both temptations. Instead, she plucked at
the sleeve of the high-school boy at her side.</p>

<p>"Will you do me a favor, <i>please</i>?"</p>

<p>The high-school boy would.</p>

<p>"Run down there to the diamond, then," Molly
commanded, "and ask the captain of the Belden team
to come here a minute, <i>please</i>!"</p>

<p>She liked the boy in uniform who responded to her
call. He had round blue eyes, lots of freckles, and a
smile that came without coaxing. It was easy to tell
him the troubles Lakeville's team was encountering.</p>

<p>"So they are coming, you understand," she finished
breathlessly. "If you will just hold the game a few
minutes, till they get here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why sure!" The boy fumbled with his cap and
spoke awkwardly, but there was no doubting his sincerity.
"We meant to postpone the start till your
team came, of course."</p>

<p>"But that&mdash;that man&mdash;" Molly halted until she
had spied the important person and pointed him out to
the Belden captain. "That man said he would tell the
umpire to forfeit the game at three o'clock if our boys
weren't here."</p>

<p>"So he could make a speech, huh?" The boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
smile revealed two rows of gleaming white teeth.
"That's old Senator Cannon, who used to be in the
State legislature; he'd rather make a speech, I guess,
than eat. Regular talking machine, that man. But
he isn't running our ball team. Why, he wanted to
award the pennant last week, after we licked Elkana&mdash;so's
he could make a speech, you see."</p>

<p>"The idea!" sniffed Miss Sefton in her most grown-up
manner.</p>

<p>"But we fellows voted 'no' on his little scheme.
Said we had Lakeville to trim for a clear title to the
State championship. That's why we are so keen to
play to-day, even if we start a bit late. You know,
it's this afternoon or never, because school ended
yesterday, and we can't very well postpone the game."</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't have to worry that way," Molly
assured the Belden captain. "Our team is surely
coming. It&mdash;it&mdash;" She faltered at sight of the
messenger, on his third trip that day. Some inkling
of impending disaster gripped her. Before she spoke
again, she moistened her lips. "Well, what is it
now?"</p>

<p>"Message for Horace Hibbs."</p>

<p>Molly reached for the paper. She had meant to ask
for it, but the words would not come. All at once,
she was afraid of what those scrawled words might
reveal. The Belden captain watched her curiously.</p>

<p>But she was no coward. She would prove that
much. So, calling upon every ounce of her will power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to steady her fingers, she calmly unfolded the paper
and read the message. There was not even the flicker
of an eyebrow to suggest its import. When she had
deciphered the final blur that stood for "Leland",
she looked up at the boy.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said in a low, hurt voice, "but
I am afraid we can't play the game, after all. The
team is&mdash;is not coming."</p>

<p>For the message read:</p>

<p class="pq1 p1">Tell Horace Hibbs, baseball park, that no train will
leave Elkana for Belden before night. Too far and
too late to use automobile. We are getting ready to
start back home.&mdash;Leland.</p>

<p class="p1">If the Belden boy spoke to her, Molly did not hear
him. For a time, indeed, the measured <i>pound-pound-pound</i>
of her heart tolled so loudly that it deafened her
to all else. Not till her quickening ears counted the
three strokes of some belled clock in town did she
become conscious of the babel about her.</p>

<p>It was time for the game to begin. To the rhythm
of thousands of stamping feet, the fans were dinning,
"Start the game! Start the game!" Off down the
road, outside the park, a muffled roar grew and doubled
in volume, like distant thunder coming closer and
closer. It rumbled to the very gate; it died to a faint
putter. As the great swinging doors flung wide, it
belched forth once more, nerve-racking, ear-rending.</p>

<p>Then Molly gasped and stared.</p>

<p>Into the ball park rolled the queerest contrivance she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
had ever seen&mdash;a great engine, running on broad,
endless belts instead of wheels, and towing behind it a
half-loaded hayrack.</p>

<p>"It's a farm tractor!" said a startled voice below
her.</p>

<p>"It's the Lakeville baseball team!" screamed Molly
watching Bunny Payton and Bi Jones jump from the
hayrack, with at least seven other boys ready to spill
over the sides.</p>

<p>She experienced a sudden absurd pity for the man
who wanted to forfeit the game, that he might make a
speech, and for the blue-eyed, freckled Belden captain
who was about to lead his team to defeat, and for all
those fans who counted confidently on a Belden victory.</p>

<p>They were very still now, very apprehensive. In
a little while, she guessed, they would be sorry the
Lakeville nine had ever come. She laughed hysterically
and sprang to her feet. With a Lakeville High
banner streaming in the wind, she shrieked at the top
of her voice:</p>

<p>"Play ball!"</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">MOLLY INSISTS</p>

<p class="pn p2">As he leaped from the hayrack, Bunny glanced apprehensively
toward the diamond. It was a little
after three, he knew, and he was afraid the game had
already begun. Even with the substitutes, Lakeville
might be holding her own; but he guessed shrewdly
that Buck and Barrett and Sheffield and the others
would be pretty glad to see the remaining members of
the regular nine.</p>

<p>But something was clearly wrong. The Belden
players were batting and fielding fungoes and grounders,
with not a single Lakeville fellow in sight. Even
the Lakeville bench was empty. And now, for the
first time, he became aware that no spontaneous cheer
had greeted the arrival of the Scouts. The scattering
applause had come from the Belden fans; it was no
more than polite interest in their appearance at this
eleventh hour. Yes, something was decidedly wrong.</p>

<p>The patter of running feet and the flutter of swishing
skirts spun him around as abruptly as if some drillmaster
had commanded, "About face!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Molly!" he said to the flushed girl who
stood before him. "Where are the other players?"</p>

<p>"They aren't coming," cried Molly Sefton breathlessly.
"A wreck blocked the track. And, oh,
Bunny, they want to forfeit the game, and a mean old
man is going to make a speech and award the pennant
to Belden, and they can't postpone it till some other
day because it's the end of the season, and everybody
thinks you are afraid to play for the championship&mdash;afraid,
Bunny! But you aren't, are you? And there
are nine of you boys here now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bunny stopped her with a bewildered gesture.
"Just a moment, Molly. Let's understand all this."
And he began to ply her with questions, till the whole
story was told. At its end, he nodded dubiously.</p>

<p>"And now you're here, at last," the girl said
triumphantly, as if their presence righted the universe.</p>

<p>"Yes, we 're here," Bunny admitted. "An hour or
so ago, we didn't think there was a chance of making
it, either. You see, we were talking to a farmer who
didn't own an automobile and whose horses were all
out. He said that he didn't belong to any patrol, so
far as he knew, but that he guessed he must be a Boy
Scout at heart, because he tried to live up to all the
laws of the organization. And then, all at once, he
remembered something, and slapped his knee, and
said, 'Boys, I haven't done my good turn to-day, and
I've just thought of a way. My farm tractor needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
overhauling by the agency in Belden. I'll hitch it
up to a hayrack and haul you all there.' So he did."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that splendid!" said Molly, clapping her
hands. "And just think, there are exactly nine of
you boys&mdash;enough for a baseball team!"</p>

<p>"Nine of us, yes," agreed Bunny, "but only three
of the regular Lakeville team, not counting Bi and
myself, who are pitchers. Too many substitutes,
Molly. Still&mdash;" He paused doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Play them!" urged the girl. "Beat them! I
just know you can do it&mdash;you Scouts!"</p>

<p>Bunny considered. "I might use Bi behind the
bat," he said, weakening, "and I could pitch. With
Roundy and Jump and Specs and&mdash;and S. S., we
would have a fairly good infield. Nap might do for
center field, too." He felt this was stretching the facts
a bit, but he couldn't very well say Nap was merely
better than nobody. "Only&mdash;well, at the start of
the season, there were just two fellows in school who
didn't try for the team&mdash;Bonfire Cree and Prissy
Prissler. I'd have to play them in right and left
fields."</p>

<p>"But Bonfire can bat," Molly declared loyally.
"Don't you remember that home run he knocked the
first day of school?"</p>

<p>"It was an accident; he says so himself. You saw
him fan on three straight balls at your picnic afterward."</p>

<p>"He can bat," Molly insisted stubbornly. "I just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
know he can, if he really has to. And Prissler will do
his best to help you win. Besides, Bunny, there's that
mean old man who wants to give Belden the pennant,
and all those fans who will think you are afraid to
play."</p>

<p>Bunny smiled at her. She was only a girl, of course,
and she could not be expected to understand the difficulties
such a patched-up team must encounter. But
she believed in the Scouts; she had faith in them.
After all, however the game might go, they could not
afford to sacrifice Molly's friendship. And they might&mdash;just
<i>might</i>&mdash;win!</p>

<p>"We'll play," he told her quietly. "Now, where's
the Belden captain? I wonder if he will allow us to
practice for a few minutes."</p>

<p>The blue-eyed, freckle-faced leader of the home
team came quickly at Molly's call. "How are you,
Payton?" he said, shaking hands with the Lakeville
captain. "Practice? Sure; as long as you like.
Got any uniforms or bats or gloves or balls? H'm!
We can fix you up on everything except uniforms,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind them," Bunny interrupted. "We've
walked and ridden forty miles or so in these clothes
we're wearing, and I guess we can play baseball in
them. Hi, fellows!"</p>

<p>The practice was disquieting. The infield might
have been reasonably air-tight except for the leak at
third base. On that difficult corner of the diamond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Substitute S. S. Zane speedily proved that stopping sizzling
grounders demanded more skill than he possessed.
Out in the field, Substitute Nap Meeker missed and
snared flies for an average of about .500, Substitute
Bonfire Cree eventually managed to catch one soaring
fungo hit, and Substitute Prissy Prissler divided his
busy moments between muffing every ball that touched
his hands and misjudging all the rest.</p>

<p>The fans jeered openly. On the bench, the watchful
Belden players tried honestly to hide the pleased
grins that kept curling their mouths. Their blue-eyed,
freckle-faced captain strode out to where Bunny was
warming up by pitching to Bi.</p>

<p>"If your team needs more time for practice," he
offered generously, "don't be afraid to ask for it."</p>

<p>Bunny plumped a singing inshoot into Bi's big pad
before he answered.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "We are ready to start
the game any time now." He watched a black-garbed
man walk past, muttering to himself as if he were
rehearsing some speech. "And don't be too sure,"
he flung over his shoulder at the Belden captain, "that
you are going to win that championship, either. You
have to beat us first."</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">SUBSTITUTES' DAY</p>

<p class="pn p2">A gong clanged. The umpire brushed off home
plate with his little whisk broom. When he turned to
face the stands, the fans stilled expectantly.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "the batteries
for to-day's game are: for Lakeville, Payton and
Jones; for Belden, Bonner and Clark."</p>


<p class="pn center p1"><i>Substitute No. 1</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">Out in center field, Nap Meeker looked up at the blue
sky and said, very solemnly, "This is my lucky day."
More than one hundred years before, history has it, the
little Corsican for whom Nap was nicknamed went
forth to battle with these same words on his lips. To
both boy and soldier, perhaps, they marked the summoning
of courage for what was to come.</p>

<p>For Nap dreaded the impending game. He had
little skill as a player, and none knew it better than
himself. This afternoon, for example, he would
much have preferred to bury his nose in some unread
biography of Napoleon, and live for an hour or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
in those stirring times when ambition and accomplishment
vaulted straight to a throne.</p>

<p>But he had accepted the challenge to play. As a
Boy Scout, he could do no less. Loyalty to his leader,
to the team, and to the school, were in his mind as
inflexible as must have been the loyalty of Napoleon's
soldiers to their leader in those other days. Nor was
that the limit of Nap's resolution. If he were to play
at all, he must actually help to make victory possible.
He must offset his lack of technical skill with strategy.
He must out-guess, out-plan, out-general the opposing
team. For hadn't his hero once said that most
battles were won in the council room, before a shot
was fired?</p>

<p>As a result of the toss, which Bunny had won,
Belden batted first. Nap shuffled about nervously as
the Lakeville captain took his three practice pitches and
Bi shot the last ball to Jump, on second, who swooped
low to tag an imaginary runner. Then the umpire
lifted his hand. "Play ball!" he said; and the game
was on.</p>

<p>It was hard for Nap to remain inactive during the
first half of that initial inning. He wished he were a
star pitcher, like Bunny, with the balance of each play
hinging upon his delivery; failing that, he even found
himself hoping a fly ball might come sailing to him.
But nothing happened to test his mettle. The first
Belden batter fanned on three pitched balls; the second
fouled to Bi, who calmly slipped off his mask and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
smothered the little pop-up without moving from his
tracks; the third grounded out to Roundy, who made
the play unassisted. Then Nap trotted in from the
field, only to watch Specs, Jump and Bunny retired in
one-two-three order. He trotted back to center field
again. In a way, he began to understand what Napoleon
meant when, with the war raging elsewhere, he
chafed in the city and said, "Paris weighs on me like
a leaden mantle."</p>

<p>But in the second inning, opportunity beckoned to
Nap. A Belden batter shot a stinging grass-clipper
straight at S. S., and that youth allowed it to trickle between
his legs. The next batter flied over second.
With the cry, "Let me have it!" Nap came charging in
for the catch.</p>

<p>It was not a difficult ball to handle. Jump might
have backed under it easily. But Jump's play just
then, with a runner on first, was to guard the keystone
sack. All this Nap sensed in an instant; all
this&mdash;and something more.</p>

<p>The batter was merely trotting toward first. He
had no hope of an error; he could already see the play
reported, "Flied out to center field." But Nap, racing
toward the falling ball, was fairly quivering with
the hope of a strategy that filled his heart to bursting.</p>

<p>He was under the fly now. He lifted his hands for
the catch, stealing a final glance to assure himself that
the batter was still only half way to first; then,
abruptly, he took one backward step, allowed the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to hit the ground, caught it as it bounced, and shot it
unerringly to Jump.</p>

<p>There was no need of shouting a warning to Jump.
He was baseball wise. He knew what to do. Plumping
one foot on the bag, and thus forcing the runner
who had been on first, he whipped the ball to Roundy
for the second put-out, before the astonished batter
could galvanize his legs enough to beat the throw.
Nap had out-witted batter and runner. There were
now two out, with nobody on base.</p>

<p>All the Scouts cheered. Bunny shouted some unintelligible
word of thanks and congratulation, accompanied
by a broad grin. Stalking back to his position
in deep center field, Nap said softly to himself, "I'm
glad I did it if it pleases him." Perhaps this was some
hazy recollection of Napoleon's message to Josephine.
"I prize victory," he had written, "since it pleases
you."</p>

<p>The last Belden batter that inning swung at three
wide balls without ticking a foul.</p>

<p>For Lakeville, the last half of the second began well.
Bi laced a clean single over short. Roundy laid down
a perfect bunt, and beat out the throw to first. S. S.
walked on four balls. And it was in this tense situation,
bases full and nobody out, that Nap came to bat
for the first time.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, he would have given a million
dollars for the skill to lash out a long hit. But he
knew, deep down in his heart, that he could never do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
it. Agonizing recollections of his usual attempts, resulting
in feeble grounders to some waiting fielder,
seared his mind. Already he could foresee the havoc
he might create. In all probability, he would bat into
a double or even a triple play, that would wipe clean
the bases, like some remorseless scythe.</p>

<p>His hands slipped up on the handle of the bat.
Bonner, the Belden pitcher, wound up and threw. Before
Nap's worried eyes, a little swish of white catapulted
over the plate. The umpire jerked a thumb over
his right shoulder. "Strike one!" he said. And Nap
had barely seen that ball. No, he could never hit it
out.</p>

<p>Bonner pitched again. It was a ball this time, purposely
wide of the plate&mdash;a coaxer. Nap stood like
a statue.</p>

<p>"Ball one!"</p>

<p>A third time the pitcher wound up and threw. A
third time Nap did not offer at the ball.</p>

<p>"Strike two!"</p>

<p>On the bases, the runners took swift leads with each
lift of the pitcher's arm, scurrying back like scared
rats as the ball thudded into the catcher's glove. They
were curiously silent. Nobody shouted for him to
hit it; each of the three, Nap knew, was afraid he
would. Like him, they feared a double or triple play
might result. After all, if he stood there and allowed
the third strike to be called, it would be better than
forcing some runner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook himself angrily. How far would Napoleon
have gone if he had chosen to wait impotently?
His first rule of warfare was, "Time is everything."
At the thought, Nap gripped the bat more firmly,
edging closer to the plate. And then, quite accidentally,
he caught the signal that passed from runner to
runner&mdash;the quick lifting of a finger that meant
"Steal!"</p>

<p>Almost before he could realize that Bunny and the
rest had conceded his inability to help in this crisis, and
had determined on the desperate expedient of a triple
steal, the Belden pitcher was preparing for his last delivery.
Nap watched the wind-up with set, fascinated
eyes. It was like a snake coiling to strike.</p>

<p>Before the circling arm had completed its queer
gyrations, each runner was in action. Nap saw the
pitcher's smile freeze suddenly. Like a gun discharged
at half-cock, the ball leaped from his hand and
came whistling toward the batter. In that tick of a
second before it reached the plate, Nap found himself.</p>

<p>He could not swing and hit it. To try that would
be utterly futile. Moreover, Bi could never reach
home before the catcher had clamped the ball on him.
But there was one thing Nap could do. Gripping his
bat loosely, he held it stiffly before him, squarely in the
path of the pitch. Ball sogged against wood and
bounced back into the diamond. At the sound of the
impact, Nap raced for first.</p>

<p>Not till he had reached the base safely, and run beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
it and turned to the right to come back, did he
know what had happened. The little bunt had proved
so totally unexpected that the Belden players were
caught flat-footed. Bi scored. The pitcher, scooping
up the ball, shot it toward third, in an attempt to catch
Bunny. It was a bad throw, low and to one side, and
the guardian of that sack did well to cuff it as it passed,
checking its momentum enough to stop it a dozen feet
beyond the base line.</p>

<p>Without hesitating, Bunny followed Bi to the plate,
scoring on his very heels. S. S. quick to take advantage
of the break of luck, scampered to third. The
runs were over, and there were still two on bases, with
nobody out.</p>

<p>But here, unfortunately, Lakeville reached the hopeless
end of its batting list. Bonfire popped up an
easy foul. Prissler&mdash;well, Prissler fanned ignominiously,
just as everybody expected he would. Prissler
was no ball player. And Specs' best was a liner
straight to the shortstop.</p>

<p>In spite of these minor mishaps, Nap sauntered out
to center field with a song on his lips. Twice in that
one inning, by tactics comparable to Napoleon's best
strategy, he had helped the team. What was it the
little Corsican had said after recapturing Italy? "A
few more events"&mdash;yes, that was it&mdash;"a few more
events like this campaign, and I shall perhaps go down
to posterity." Nap crimsoned guilty at the inference;
just the same, his chin shot out pugnaciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Give him another chance, and he would wind up this
ball game "with a clap of thunder."</p>

<p>But with that one big inning ended Nap's opportunities.
Not another ball was batted to center field; not
once, in the innings that followed, was Nap on base.
It was hard to remain inactive, like&mdash;like being
weighed down by a leaden mantle; but the memory of
the trapped ball and the squeeze play was quite enough
to warrant his remarking occasionally to himself,
"This is my lucky day."</p>

<p>The score:</p>

<p class="pn center"><i>Substitute No. 2</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">S. S. Zane wanted to help win that game. In the
last half of the third inning, when Jump dumped a
Texas-leaguer into the outfield and perched proudly
on first, S. S. ran out to the coaching line.</p>

<p>"Take a lead!" he called shrilly. "Down with his
arm, ol' boy! Watch him! Watch him!&mdash;<i>Slide!</i>&mdash;Nice
work! He'll throw it away yet. He's no
pitcher! See, he's scared green! Make him pitch,
Mr. Umpire! Cowardy-calf! I tell you, Jump,
he's got a yellow streak! He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S. S.!" It was Bunny's crisp voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>The coacher turned. At the crooking of his captain's
finger, he walked back to the bench. "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"You are supposed to be coaching the runner,"
Bunny told him quietly. "That doesn't mean jeering
at the pitcher. We don't play that kind of game."</p>

<p>S. S. hung his head. "I&mdash;I'm sorry, Bunny. I
wasn't trying to rattle him. I just forgot what I was
saying, I guess."</p>

<p>There the incident ended. Bunny went out to the
coaching box himself, and devoted his attention wholly
to Jump. Back on the bench, S. S. swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean anything," he told himself gloomily.
"But Bunny's right, of course. Coaching that way
isn't good sportsmanship." He eyed the Belden
pitcher. "Wonder how I can make it up to Bonner."</p>

<p>The opportunity came in the very next inning.
Lakeville failed to score in the third, and the Belden
team came piling in for the first of the fourth.</p>

<p>It began disastrously for Lakeville. There was a
patter of hits and an appalling total of errors. The
first batter shot a stinging liner just inside third, which
eluded S. S. altogether. The next flied to short right
field, and Prissler lost the ball in the sun. Then Bonfire
allowed a grounder to escape between his legs.
Jump bobbled an easy chance. Roundy dropped a
perfect throw. Specs sailed a ball ten feet over first
on an attempted put-out. Before Lakeville could
settle down to the grim business of retiring the side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
three runs were over the plate, and the bases were still
full.</p>

<p>When Bunny fanned the next two batters, S. S.
was elated, but not particularly surprised. He knew
his captain was at his best in a pinch, and he said as
much to the Belden runner on third, who happened to
be Bonner, the opposing pitcher.</p>

<p>If this were a diplomatic effort to make friends with
Bonner by starting a conversation, it failed dismally.
The boy merely nodded, without saying anything at
all, and immediately proceeded to edge his way off
the base toward home. S. S. covered his embarrassment
by slapping his bare hand into the palm of his
glove.</p>

<p>What happened next was wholly unplanned.</p>

<p>There was no guile in the heart of the neatest Scout
of the Black Eagle Patrol. When he saw that the
Belden pitcher's shoestring was loose and dangling,
he called attention to it in the most matter-of-fact,
good-turn way in the world; and when Bonner glanced
down, standing a few feet off third base, and Bunny
suddenly snapped the ball to S. S., the latter caught
it mechanically and tagged the runner before he
could scramble back to safety, solely and simply
because baseball instinct told him that was the thing
to do.</p>

<p>But it was the third out. It nipped a promising
rally. And it had all the earmarks of a carefully
planned trick. Bonner looked at S. S. just once, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
such scorn in his steel-blue eyes that S. S. wished with
all his heart the earth might open up then and there
and swallow him from sight.</p>

<p>But he did not abandon his ambition. Sooner or
later, he would prove to that fellow that he could
play real ball, and that he was not the kind who resorted
to questionable tactics to win a point.</p>

<p>The last half of the fourth inning was uneventful.
Only three Lakeville batters faced the pitcher&mdash;Nap,
Bonfire, and Prissler; and, as S. S. confided to Bi, nobody
could expect them to do anything. They justified
his expectations in every way by fanning unanimously.</p>

<p>Belden threatened again in the fifth inning. With
runners on second and first, and one out, the Lakeville
infield played close, to shut off a run at home. As
luck would have it, the batter lashed a stinging grounder
toward S. S.</p>

<p>It was a hard hit ball, that even Sheffield, Lakeville's
regular third baseman, would have done well to knock
down, much less to field cleanly for an out. S. S.
missed it altogether. Under the circumstances, this
was a pardonable error. But his sudden leap, backward
and to one side, which threatened a collision with
the Belden runner coming from second, made the
play look bad.</p>

<p>The runner halted instinctively for a fatal moment.
S. S., now between him and the plate, lunged awkwardly
for the ball, without getting his hands anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
near it, and it shot between his legs against the
Belden boy.</p>

<p>"Out!" boomed the umpire; "hit by batted ball."</p>

<p>The Belden coacher on third clucked, just clucked.
He did not say a single word. But when S. S. identified
him as Bonner, whom he had already twice
offended, he realized what the boy was thinking. And
it was ridiculously wrong! S. S. had not missed the
grounder deliberately; he had tried with all his scant
skill to get his hands on the ball.</p>

<p>What was the use, anyhow?</p>

<p>S. S. did not bat in the last half of the fifth, which
proved a quick inning. There was a caught fly, a
screaming single that kindled hope, and a fast double
play that snuffed it as abruptly as it had flamed. Then
Belden came to bat again.</p>

<p>Bunny disposed of the first two batters by forcing
them to hit weak flies to the infield, but the third lined
far out to right, and pulled up at third before Prissler
retrieved the ball. Playing deep for the next batter,
S. S. saw the Belden captain stroll up to the plate,
grinning cheerfully. He hoped with all his heart
that Bunny would fan him; if he did, S. S. resolved to
take revenge for Bonner's implied insults by making
some casual remark about the way not to hit 'em out.
He was beginning to hate that complacent, smiling
youngster.</p>

<p>As S. S. waited for Bunny to pitch, his keen eyes,
trained to observe by scoutcraft, detected something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
that made him chuckle outright. The bat which Bonner
was waving belligerently over the plate was the
same one Bunny had used in the preceding inning,
when he hit into a double play. At the time, S. S.
had marveled at the weak grounder his usually reliable
captain dribbled to the shortstop's waiting hands, and
he had found the answer in the broken bat, which had
cracked in its impact against the ball. And now, blissfully
ignorant of the defect, Mister Blue Eyes expected
to drive in a run with that decrepit bit of ash. Why,
he couldn't hit it out of the diamond in a thousand
years!</p>

<p>Bunny pitched a ball just wide of the plate. The
batter eyed it without swinging.</p>

<p>S. S. chuckled again. But suddenly, without any
reason at all, the gurgle died in his throat. Something
stronger than his own desire seemed to yank him out
of himself, and words that came quite without bidding
formed on his lips and were spoken.</p>

<p>"Hi, Bonner!" they said to the boy at the plate.
"That bat's busted."</p>

<p>The Belden captain lifted a wary head. He was
clearly suspicious of some fresh trick, and he never
took his eyes off Bunny. S. S. guessed he expected
a strike might be sneaked over if he turned away.
But when Bunny waited politely, the boy banged the
end of the bat against the plate. It rang hollowly, and
he promptly discarded it for another.</p>

<p>In another minute, when S. S. saw the grounder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
come zipping toward him, he wondered why on earth
he had warned the batter. This hit ball was going to
be hard to handle. But he set himself, with legs close
together this time, and waited for it to reach him.
He even had time to judge its speed, and to follow its
course through grass and dust, and to decide that he
could get the runner at home. He glowed with confidence.</p>

<p>Just at the last, though, the ball hit a pebble and
bounced high over his head. With a frantic upward
fling of his gloved hand, S. S. speared it neatly. But
the unbraced feet and the chug of the ball were too
much for his balance. He toppled over backward,
and sat down with a pronounced thump.</p>

<p>It was clearly too late to throw across the diamond
to first. If the play were to be made at all, it must be
at home; and S. S. realized in a flash that by the time
he came to his feet and threw, the runner would have
scored. There was just one thing to do, and he did it.
Still sitting awkwardly on the ground, he drew back
his arm and shot the ball with all his might to the waiting
Bi.</p>

<p>The runner slid. But good, old reliable Bi Jones,
straddling the plate, took the perfect throw and
clamped the ball on him a long ways from the rubber&mdash;oh,
a good three or four inches, S. S. decided. He
nodded at the umpire's decision. The fellow was out,
of course; S. S. knew it all the time.</p>

<p>Coming in to the bench, he passed Bonner, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
was grinning a little wryly. "Thanks," the Belden
captain said to S. S.</p>

<p>"For what?" snapped Zane, quickly on the defensive.</p>

<p>"Why, for telling me the bat was broken. I liked
that. You didn't suppose I was thanking you for
throwing out Clark at home, did you? That was a
dandy play, let me tell you, even if it was against us;
yes, sir, as pretty a stop and throw as I ever saw."</p>

<p>S. S.'s face glowed like a full moon. "Oh, it
wasn't much," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>But it was. He knew it was. So was the warning
about the bat. He had helped save the game, and he
had proved to the doubting Bonner that he was a good
sportsman. He liked that laughing, blue-eyed, freckle-faced
boy; he wished he would move to Lakeville.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Prissler, at the tail-end of the batting list, had already
struck out twice, and he expected to do it again
when he faced the Belden pitcher in the last half of the
sixth inning. Instead, he walked on four balls.</p>

<p>Somehow, it did not seem quite fair. He had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
nothing to deserve the honor of being a base runner,
and he felt a little sorry that the rules permitted him
to profit by the pitcher's wildness. He was on first,
precisely as he would have been after hitting safely.
Yet he had made no hit; had not the skill, indeed, to
make one. In some unaccountable manner, he had
gained an advantage he did not deserve.</p>

<p>Prissler had batted first in that inning. Specs, up
next, flied out. Jump fanned. There were now two
out, with Bunny at bat.</p>

<p>After allowing the first pitched ball to sing past
without offering at it, Bunny met the second squarely.
At the crack of the bat, Prissler dashed for second.</p>

<p>"It's a homer!" shrieked Specs excitedly. He was
coaching off third. "Come on, Prissy! Come on!"</p>

<p>Both the shortstop and the second baseman were
facing the outfield, watching the soaring ball. Prissler
touched the bag and wheeled toward third. At
that corner of the diamond, Specs was executing a war-dance,
with wildly swinging arms.</p>

<p>"Go on in, Prissy!" he yelled, waving him toward
home. "Come on, Bunny! Come on!"</p>

<p>Prissler crossed the plate standing up. Bunny,
close behind, flung himself toward the white rubber in
a headlong slide. It was nip and tuck between ball
and runner, but the latter beat the throw by inches.</p>

<p>"&mdash;safe!" came the tag of the umpire's decision.
At the word, Prissler experienced an irresistible desire
to turn a somersault; and did it, moreover, to the profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
amazement of the Lakeville team, which had
never seen him so undignified before.</p>

<p>But it was excusable. Not only had the Lakeville
boys tied the score, but they were now leading by one
run.</p>

<p>After the decision, the Belden catcher straightened
up, with the ball resting in his big glove. He wrapped
the fingers of his right hand about it, and drew back
his arm for the throw to his pitcher. Then, as if
changing his mind, he shot it to the third baseman,
who caught it and stamped a decisive foot upon the
sack.</p>

<p>The umpire shook his head. Prissler, watching the
pantomime, wrinkled his brow. He wondered what it
all meant.</p>

<p>"But I tell you he didn't," the third baseman said
angrily. "That first runner didn't touch the bag at
all. He cut across 'way out there."</p>

<p>Again the umpire shook his head.</p>

<p>Now Prissler began to understand. They were
claiming he had failed to touch third before starting
for home. He tried to remember. He had been running
from second, toward Specs, who had waved him
to keep on. He had answered the signal by turning
in the direction of the plate and&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is right," Prissler told the umpire suddenly.
"I <i>did</i> cut across the corner of the diamond without
touching third."</p>

<p>He could not understand the stunned silence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
followed. Specs' jaw dropped in consternation. One
of the other fellows coughed unnaturally. In the eyes
of the two or three Belden players within hearing grew
a queer light of grudging admiration. With an effort,
the umpire found his voice.</p>

<p>"Runner is out at third," he ruled.</p>

<p>So, after all, the two runs did not count. Technically,
Bunny's long hit could be scored as only a two-bagger,
although he had circled the bases before the
ball could be relayed home. Moreover, the inning
was over.</p>

<p>The seventh began badly. Perhaps Bunny was still
winded; perhaps the disappointment kept him from
pitching his best. Whatever the reason, the first two
batters hit safely, the third advanced them with a neat
sacrifice bunt, and only Jump's bare-handed catch of
a liner prevented immediate scoring. Then, in his
eagerness to keep the ball out of the groove, Bunny
walked another, filling the bases, with two out.</p>

<p>In right field, Prissler stooped nervously and
plucked a blade of grass. Without quite understanding
why, he felt he was indirectly to blame for the
threatening situation. It dated back to that play
at third, upon which the umpire had reversed his decision.</p>

<p>"But I was out fairly," Prissler told himself wonderingly,
kicking at a tuft of roots. "I couldn't say
anything else, could I?"</p>

<p>He looked up just in time to see the Belden batter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
swing viciously against a pitched ball. It was a low
fly, and it lifted straight toward right field.</p>

<p>In his first flurry of indecision, Prissler stood stock-still,
thereby proving himself a poor fielder. Any
expert player would have been upon his toes and away
before the crash of meeting bat and ball had dwindled
to an echo; for it was obvious that the fly must fall
in short right field, just beyond reach of the second
baseman.</p>

<p>But Prissler's tardy recognition of this fact was
only momentary. In another instant, he was in action,
racing with all his might toward the falling ball,
and noting, out of the corner of his eye, that the
Belden runners were circling the bases like some human
merry-go-round. If he missed the catch, at least
three runs would score.</p>

<p>But it looked impossible. The ball was falling like
a plummet, well out of reach of his extended hands.
He pumped his legs desperately. Bunny might have
made it in time, or Specs, or some of those other fellows
who had the knack of sprinting. He was afraid
he couldn't.</p>

<p>With only a tantalizing step or two to cover, Prissler
saw that the ball was nearly level with his eyes. He
threw himself forward, in a very frenzy of determination.
He felt himself falling. But he never took
his eyes from that white comet. As he plunged to
the earth, in a great welter of dust, his hands thrust
forth spasmodically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Something drove hard against his glove, slapping it
to the ground. Instinctively, his left hand leaped to
cover the precious ball. A shoulder hit wrenchingly,
toppling him over in a curious tumble, from which he
recovered with astonishing agility, coming to his feet
like some jack-in-the-box, and trotting on into the
diamond, with the ball held proudly aloft.</p>

<p>Instantly, there grew a confusion of shouts.</p>

<p>"He didn't catch it!"</p>

<p>"Trapped it; that's what he did!"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't, either!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, he did!"</p>

<p>Prissler smiled. He knew. He looked at the umpire
for confirmation. But the official was standing
there motionless, with a questioning expression on his
face that said, as plainly as words, "I don't know
whether the ball was trapped or caught." Prissler
seemed to go cold all over.</p>

<p>But the umpire was a very wise man. He looked
the boy straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you catch it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Prissler, "I did. I caught it fair
and square."</p>

<p>"Batter is out!" declared the umpire, with just a
hint of defiance in his voice. He expected a volley
of protest.</p>

<p>The Belden third baseman looked at the Belden
catcher, and they both looked at their blue-eyed,
freckle-faced captain. Each one remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
other play in which Prissler had figured. To their
credit, be it said all three smiled bravely in the face of
their bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>"If he says he caught it," the Belden captain nodded
soberly, "we know he did." The catcher and the
third baseman agreed. Not a single Belden player
questioned the evidence.</p>

<p>This decision, when you come to think it over, was
about as splendid a tribute to the honesty of a player
as baseball history records. But Prissler saw nothing
remarkable about it. He had caught the ball, and it
was no more than fair that the batter should be called
out. What pleased him most was the fact that the
runs which had crowded over the plate did not count.</p>

<p>The score:</p>

<p class="pn center"><i>Substitute No. 4</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">Long before the spectacular ninth inning, you might
have thought Bonfire Cree had done his share. To
him Bunny was indebted for many pitching hints: this
Belden batter could not hit a ball around his knees;
this one was dazed by speed; this one crowded the
plate and must be driven back by in-curves; this one
swung awkwardly at shoulder-high pitches. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
he had solved a certain sequence of deliveries by
the Belden twirler. Perhaps Bonner himself was unconscious
of any order in his pitches, but he began always
with a coaxer, a little wide of the plate, following
it with a straight, fast ball, squarely in the groove, and
then with either an out or an in curve. Quite naturally,
this knowledge gave the batter an advantage.</p>

<p>All this aided greatly; but still Bonfire was not satisfied.
He might have observed and tabulated these
facts from the bench. They had nothing to do with
his own playing; and through eight long innings, he
had failed to distinguish himself at bat or in the field.</p>

<p>Just before the ninth inning began, with the score
still 3-2 in Belden's favor, he turned to Bunny. "I
am like a coach who never made the team," he said,
smiling a little wistfully. "I tell the others what to
do and how to do it; but I can't seem to use the information
for my own good."</p>

<p>"Never mind," consoled Bunny. "You've helped
as much as the best player on the team. It looks bad
now, I'll admit, but maybe we can stage a rally in the
last of the ninth."</p>

<p>Now, accidents will happen with the best of regulated
batters. After Bunny had fanned the boy who
could not hit a ball around his knees by feeding him
nothing else, and added a second strike-out to his
credit by scorching three sizzling pitches to the one
who was not on batting terms with speed, the next fellow,
who crowded the plate, upset all precedent by taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
one backward step and meeting an inshoot flush
on the nose.</p>

<p>The minute the ball was hit, Bonfire groaned.
"That's good for three bases," he said positively,
without even turning to watch its flight over right
field.</p>

<p>Prissler chased dutifully after the ball, but it was
far over his head. The best fielder in the world could
never have reached it in time, and Prissler laid no
claims to that title. Before he could pick it up, after
it had rolled nearly to the fence, and line it to Jump,
via a relay to S. S., the runner was squatting comfortably
on third.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" shouted some Belden fan who
thought he was funny. "There goes your old ball
game. Look who's up now&mdash;'Home-run' Hogan!"</p>

<p>The batter was squat and broad of shoulder. Already
he was credited with three hits in this game, and
Bonfire had confessed to Bunny that he seemed to have
no weakness.</p>

<p>"You just pitch to him," he had laughed, "and then
throw up your hands to keep from getting hit by what
he slams back at you."</p>

<p>Bunny measured this dangerous opponent a long
time before he pitched. But when he finally shot over
the first delivery, it was a clean strike. Out in left
field, Bonfire nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"No use to pass him," he agreed. "That Belden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
captain, Bonner, who is up next, is nearly as dangerous.
No, the play is to make Hogan hit to save
fielder." Aloud he called, "Get him, Bunny!"</p>

<p>Hogan watched disdainfully as the second pitch
zipped past, wide of the plate. You couldn't fool that
fellow. But the third, waist-high, straight over, was
exactly to his liking. With a hunch of his powerful
shoulders, he swung his mighty bludgeon of a bat hard
against the ball.</p>

<p>It was a fly to left field, as long as the one that had
baffled Prissler a moment before, but much higher.
At the crack of the bat, Bonfire wheeled abruptly and
began to run, picking a little tuft of grass, yards and
yards away, as the target toward which the ball was
speeding.</p>

<p>Head down, arms chugging, he ran as he had never
run before. Even so, his hope of smothering the fly
seemed utterly forlorn. In the first place, he was not
a great sprinter; he probably could not reach it in time.
But granting that his legs carried him over the ground
fast enough, he had not gauged the course of the ball
with his eyes; he could never hope to turn at the last
instant, and find the falling ball in his very path. The
Belden fans jeered his amateurish efforts, and shouted
encouragement to the circling Hogan.</p>

<p>As he lifted a foot to plump it down on the little
tuft of grass, Bonfire jerked his head around and flung
up his hands. Into them, as accurately as if he had
been watching it from the first, dropped the ball. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
had made the catch over his left shoulder, almost at his
neck.</p>

<p>At first, the Belden fans were disgruntled.
"Horseshoes!" yelled one in disgust; and, "You
lucky fish!" wailed another. But, in the end, they
applauded the wonderful play.</p>

<p>In a way, of course, as Bonfire readily admitted to
himself, it was luck: the same type of luck that makes
a pitcher fling up a gloved hand to shield his face from
a screaming liner, only to have the ball hit his palm and
stick there. But it was something more than mere
luck in Bonfire's case; it was the result of a whole
season of observation and experiment.</p>

<p>The secret of the catch was buried deep in the boy's
peculiarly inquisitive and analytic mind.</p>

<p>Big-league fielders did not wait till the ball was high
in the air before running to get under it. At the crack
of the bat, they were off. In the few professional
games Bonfire had seen, he decided these star fielders
estimated the force of the drive from the sound of
crashing wood and horsehide, and the direction from
the first glimpse of the rising ball. It was a knack
of determining the spot where the fly would land; a
kind of baseball instinct that could be developed only
by infinite patience and observation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Lakeville season, Bonfire set
himself the stint of training his eyes and ears. Day
after day, while the nine practiced or played games,
he tested his own powers. Sometimes he sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
bench, alert to hear and see; sometimes he wandered
out toward the fielders. But always, when a fly was
hit, his ear registered the crack of the flailing bat, and
his eye followed the ascending ball. Then, abruptly,
he turned away. It would fall on that spot, he guessed,
picking a target in the outfield; or there; or there.
At first, naturally, he was often yards and yards astray
in his calculations; but as the season waned, with no
lessening of his tense study, he came gradually to
guessing closer and closer, till finally the accuracy of
his snap decisions was almost uncanny.</p>

<p>"Bonfire," beamed Bunny happily, slapping the hero
of the play on his back, after the Lakeville team had
come in for the last of the ninth inning, "that was the
most wonderful catch I ever saw. Honest, it was. I
didn't know you had it in you. Why didn't you try
for the team this spring?"</p>

<p>Bonfire stared at him quizzically. "Too big a
coward, maybe," he said. "I was such a dub in track
events and football and basketball and in baseball,
too&mdash;last fall, I mean&mdash;that I didn't want to run
the risk of being jeered and laughed at any more.
Next season&mdash;" He allowed the sentence to remain
unfinished, but his quick smile was more a promise
than any words could have been.</p>

<p>With Belden leading by one run, and the game almost
over, Lakeville began the ninth inning with a
do-or-die energy. Roundy, up first, singled cleanly.
Ordinarily, that hit would have stirred the team into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
ecstasies; now it called forth only a few half-hearted
cheers. For Roundy was the last regular player on
the batting list. After him, as Specs put it tersely,
came nothing. "Nothing", in this case, meant the
four substitutes.</p>

<p>Nap fouled out to the catcher. S. S. fanned; he always
fanned, it seemed; if he had done anything else,
the others would have thought it the end of the world.
This brought Bonfire to bat, which is only another
way of saying that the game was apparently lost; for
every player on the Lakeville bench recalled his ludicrous
attempts to connect with the ball when they had
tested him at Molly's picnic.</p>

<p>But Bonfire was undismayed. Accidents might
happen. Hadn't he knocked a home run that first day
of school? And hadn't he studied batting as assiduously
as he had studied fielding through the long season?</p>

<p>He knew how to grip his bat, six or eight inches
from the knob, and how to take a choppy swing with
his wrists, body and arms, stepping forward and sidewise
to meet the ball. His older brother, who was
something of a celebrity in college baseball, had
drilled him in these technical points. During almost
the whole of the Christmas holidays, when Bonfire had
visited him, the two had repaired to the baseball cage
of the college gymnasium; big brother pitching and
explaining, little brother batting and&mdash;more and more
frequently as they progressed&mdash;hitting. Later in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
spring, two other loyal friends, sworn to secrecy, had
thrown and thrown to him in the seclusion of the Cree
backyard. At the outset, as in the fielding stunt, he
had been chagrined over his failures. Little Jimmy
White had fanned him; Molly Sefton had fanned him.
But the time came when neither could fool him, when
his bat lashed hard and true against their best offerings.</p>

<p>It was with these memories in mind that Bonfire
stood facing the Belden pitcher. In the earlier innings,
he had flied out once, walked twice, and missed a
twisting third strike on his other trip to the plate.
Bonner had him tabbed as a weakling with the bat;
even his own team mates did not expect him to hit.
Bonfire's lips set in a straight, firm line.</p>

<p>He waited unmoving as the first ball sped past. It
was the usual coaxer, a bit wide of the plate. But
when the pitcher wound up again, Bonfire braced himself,
breathing quickly. The straight, fast ball was due.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hit it," he told himself in a matter-of-fact
way. "I'm going to hit it&mdash;hard."</p>

<p>The pitch began. From the coil of whirling arms,
the ball leaped toward the plate. At the same instant,
Bonfire tensed the muscles of his arms and began the
swing of his body. Ball and bat met exactly above
the center of the plate.</p>

<p>"Over left-fielder's head," Bonfire exulted, trained
ears and eyes determining the end of that parabola to
be marked by the soaring ball, half liner, half fly.
"Two-bagger, sure; maybe three."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>He rounded first at full speed. Ahead of him somewhere,
Roundy was tearing around the bases. A
coacher waved excited arms to Bonfire. "Go on!"
he shrieked. "Keep going!"</p>

<p>Just before his leg hit the sack at second, Bonfire
stole a glance toward left field. The ball was rolling
along the ground now, far beyond a youth who was
frantically chasing after it. Bonfire swept on to third.</p>

<p>Roundy scored. Bunny, coaching off third, was
threshing his arms wildly toward home, as if he were
intent upon sweeping the runner over the plate. "Go
on, Bonfire!" he yelled. "You can make it!"</p>

<p>Legs pounding like flying piston rods, Bonfire began
the last lap of his race against the ball. For half the
distance between third and home, he ran without hearing
a sound from the Belden fans. The silence spurred
him on. But suddenly they waked into rustling hope.
The ball was coming in. They murmured. They
rumbled. They roared. They thundered like madmen.
High above the din, Bonfire caught Specs' excited
treble.</p>

<p>"Slide!" the voice vibrated. "Slide!"</p>

<p>Bonfire threw himself forward in a magnificent headlong
dive. His hand ploughed toward the plate.
Pebbles scratched his palm. Dust swirled up in clouds.
And then, as his groping fingers found the cool rubber,
he heard a thud above him, and the catcher clamped
the ball hard on his protruding arm.</p>

<p>Bonfire leaped to his feet. The play had been close,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
very close. For an instant, he could see nothing but a
cloud of dust. But as it cleared, his eyes found the
umpire.</p>

<p>The man was leaning forward, arms flung wide,
palms down. And he was saying, "Runner is safe!"</p>

<p>Lakeville had won the game and the State interscholastic
baseball championship,&mdash;Lakeville and its substitutes.</p>

<p>The score:</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE TWENTY-FIFTH BOY</p>

<p class="pn p2">Bunny was sure the young man who shared his seat
on the train must be mistaken.</p>

<p>"You see," he told him, "there are only eight Boy
Scouts in a patrol, and there is only one patrol in Lakeville.
Besides, I am one of those eight. That leaves
only seven you could have seen, because I have been
visiting my uncle in Elkana for a week."</p>

<p>The young man was stubborn. "I know what I saw
with my own eyes," he insisted. "Last Thursday afternoon,
when I was in Lakeville, there were at least
twenty kids around town in Boy Scout uniforms."</p>

<p>Bunny nodded politely. "Maybe some patrols from
other places were there," he suggested, beginning to
wish he had postponed his visit to Uncle George, instead
of stopping over on the trip back from the Belden
baseball game. Perhaps the Black Eagles had been
entertaining, and he had missed some fun.</p>

<p>"That may be," agreed the young man, ready to
dismiss the subject. He glanced impatiently at his
watch, and clutched the sleeve of the passing conductor.
"How late is this train, anyhow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The conductor looked out the car window. "We
are just coming into Lakeville," he said. "We are due
there at 6:03, and it is now 7:08; call it an hour behind
time. Those two hot-boxes&mdash;" He passed on,
leaving the balance of the sentence dangling apologetically
in the air.</p>

<p>As familiar objects swept into view, several passengers
rose from their seats. The train passed the
Fair Play Factory at full speed, began to brake opposite
Horace Hibbs' modest home in the outskirts, and
ground to a stop at the station. The very first person
to alight was Bunny Payton.</p>

<p>Peter Hinkle, the station master, waved him a welcome.
Since the Black Eagles had parked the former
barren spot on the other side of the tracks with green
sod and a border of gay flowers, spelling out the name
of the town with whitewashed stones, Peter had been
their sturdy champion.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" he said. "Here's another Boy
Scout. The town's full of them now."</p>

<p>There it was again. Bunny stepped forward eagerly
to ask questions; but the station master was too busy
with the incoming baggage to stop for a talk. Moreover,
the sight of a familiar blue hat and blue-and-white
dress down the platform drew Bunny like a magnet.
It was spring, and he was growing up.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mary Chester," he said, extending his hand.</p>

<p>The girl shook hands shyly. It was the first time the
two had met since the memorable rescue on the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father and I came down to mail a letter on the
train," she explained. A smile lighted her face so
glowingly that Bunny wondered why he had never before
realized what a pretty girl Mary Jennie Chester
really was. "Oh, Bunny, I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>"About our winning that baseball game?"</p>

<p>"No-o. Oh, yes, I am glad about that, too. But I
meant about what's happened to you Boy Scouts. I
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary!" called Mr. Chester from the light runabout
drawn up by the platform.</p>

<p>With an embarrassed, "Good-by, Bunny," the girl
hurried away to join her father, leaving him standing
there with open mouth, looking, if the truth must be
confessed, very confused and very foolish. What on
earth had Mary Chester meant? What was the mystery
about the Boy Scouts?</p>

<p>Across the road from the station, on the sidewalk,
Bunny met Molly Sefton.</p>

<p>"Look here," he demanded shortly, "what's all this
talk about something happening to the Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>Molly eyed him a little coldly. She must have witnessed
his meeting with Mary Chester. He wondered
uncertainly if that could account for her lack of cordial
greeting; and all at once, without exactly understanding
why, he blushed like a silly schoolgirl. He
was sixteen years old now; almost a man.</p>

<p>"Oh, how are you, Bunny?" said Molly, in a listless,
aloof tone that sounded like the snobbish Marion Genevieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Chester in her snobbishest days. "The Boy
Scouts? Oh, they're doing wonderfully well, I hear."</p>

<p>The tiniest wedge of a misunderstanding drove home.
Bewildered, offended, unwilling to allow the doubt to
remain unchallenged, yet helpless before its baffling
vagueness, Bunny made some perfunctory remark.
They discussed the weather; they wondered if the trains
were always going to be late; they hoped the fire in
Grady's barn had taught Royal Sheffield not to throw
lighted matches on the floor, after he had examined
cuts in the tires of his car; they spoke of the spring
election that had transferred the county seat from
Dunkirk to Lakeville. And then, both of them very
miserable, they parted.</p>

<p>Opposite the Magoon residence, Felix came galloping
out, tail wagging, and intimated that he was ready
to run after a thrown stick. But Bunny was in no
mood for the game. Twisting faithful Felix's ear in
apologetic recognition, the boy plodded on toward
home, where his Aunt Emma was probably keeping
supper hot for him. He wondered how he was going
to eat anything&mdash;now.</p>

<p>"All I know about the Boy Scouts," said Aunt
Emma, bringing him steaming dishes from the oven,
"is that there have been some new patrols formed here
in Lakeville. They were organized early this week,
and presidents elected&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Patrol leaders?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. Let me see if I can recall who the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
presidents&mdash;patrol leaders, I mean&mdash;are." She
checked them off on her fingers. "Royal Sheffield;
that's one. And Arthur Claxton; that's two. And&mdash;and
Rodman Cree; that's three."</p>

<p>Halfway to his mouth, Bunny halted the fork that
had speared a juicy bite of roast beef. Striving hard
to keep his hand from trembling, he put it back on his
plate. When he spoke, it was with forced carelessness.</p>

<p>"How many new patrols are there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Two, I think. Gracious me, Bunny Payton, how
can you expect me to keep posted on the Boy Scouts,
with you away? But I understand there were two
new patrols, in addition to the Black Eagles. That's
three altogether. I counted three pres&mdash;leaders,
didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, that's right. Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you.
There is to be a big meeting in the clubhouse to-night
at seven o'clock. It's after seven now, but&mdash;Why,
Bunny! You aren't going to run off without finishing
your supper, are you? You haven't eaten enough to
keep a sparrow alive. I do hope you aren't coming
down with anything. Did Uncle George look after&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Bunny was gone. Snatching his cap from the
hall rack, he dashed out the door while she was still
speaking. Aunt Emma sighed. She wondered if she
would ever understand boys.</p>

<p>The clubhouse of the Black Eagles was ablaze with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
light. At the door, Bunny hesitated, uncertain of his
welcome. While he was summoning courage to enter,
he placed an affectionate hand on one of the rough logs
that formed the wall, and stared with winking eyes
at the jutting roof overhead. It was not a showy
house, but it was staunch and honest from peak to
foundation. He remembered the sacrifices he had
made to help build it for the old patrol.</p>

<p>The doorway was in the shadow of one of the
middle pillars. Under cover of this half-light, Bunny
edged cautiously into the big room. All the boys in
town seemed to be there, from Buck Claxton, sitting
on the front bench, to Prissy Prissler, conspicuous in
a new Scout uniform. Bunny counted them with nervous
haste. Twenty-four. He counted again, hoping
against hope that he had miscalculated. But the result
was the same. Twenty-four boys; twenty-four
Scouts. A patrol was eight; three times eight was
twenty-four. The twenty-fifth&mdash;well, there was no
use dodging the plain facts. There were three full
patrols, with one boy over. He sucked in his breath
with a curious whistling sound.</p>

<p>On the platform at the far end of the room, Horace
Hibbs rose to his feet. He had a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"First of all, boys," he began, beaming upon them
with his fatherly smile, "I shall read you the roster
of the Scouts of the Lakeville Troop. It is composed,
as you all know, of three patrols&mdash;the Kangaroos, the
Buffaloes, and the Black Eagles. The membership of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the Kangaroo Patrol is as follows: Leader, Sheffield;
Assistant Leader, Kiproy; No. 3, Collins&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bunny did not hear the other names. He was waiting
with fast-beating heart for the roll call of the Black
Eagles. But when Scout Master Hibbs finished with
the Kangaroos, he began reading the names of those
who had formed the Buffalo Patrol:</p>

<p>"Leader, Claxton; Assistant Leader, Barrett; No. 3,
Turner&mdash;"</p>

<p>It seemed to Bunny he would never come to the end
of the list. When he did finally, the boy at the door
shrank deeper into the enshrouding gloom.</p>

<p>"The present organization of the Black Eagles,"
droned Horace Hibbs, "is as follows: Leader, Cree;
Assistant Leader, Jones; No. 3, Meeker; No. 4, McGrew;
No. 5, Zane; No. 6, Magoon; No. 7, Henderson;
No. 8, Prissler."</p>

<p>Well, it was over at last. Bunny knew now who
that twenty-fifth boy was&mdash;himself. What had happened?
Why had he been dropped? He groped his
way toward the door of the clubhouse,&mdash;the house
that he had planned and helped to build. It was
wrong! It couldn't be true! Surely, his ears had
played him some hideous trick.</p>

<p>"It has been voted," Horace Hibbs went on, "that
I act as Scout Master for the Lakeville Troop. In accepting
the office&mdash;" The voice halted weakly. Before
Bunny looked up, he knew what he would see:
the gray-haired man wiping his glasses and smiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
half proudly, because to him the position was a very
real honor, and half wistfully, because the snow on his
head marked the years since he had been a boy himself
in more than heart. In spite of his own hurt, Bunny
understood and sympathized.</p>

<p>"I shall try," Horace Hibbs promised, after a pause,
"to live up to your trust in me, boys. If you will just
try to like me as well as I like all of you now, I think
we shall get along together."</p>

<p>There came another moment of silence. Bunny
stiffened apprehensively. Almost any time now, the
meeting might be adjourned. If they found him
there&mdash;</p>

<p>"And finally," continued Horace Hibbs, striving
to cover his emotion by resuming his businesslike tone,
"I wish to thank you, in behalf of our absent member,
for the trust and confidence you have placed in him
by electing him troop leader. If Bunny Payton were
here, I might properly hesitate to praise him to his face;
but now I feel that I may speak freely of his&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old adage has it that eavesdroppers never hear
good of themselves. On this particular occasion, it
bade fair to be shattered and laid on the shelf. It
would have been, too, but for one saving incident.</p>

<p>Before Horace Hibbs could launch into his eulogy,
Bunny slipped quietly out the door into the gathering
darkness. For a long moment, he stood just beyond
the threshold, breathing hard and trying to still the
mad thumping of his heart. Then, without rhyme or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
reason, he threw up his heels and began to run at the
top of his speed. The rising moon winked at him.
Felix joined noisily in the wild chase. The swaying
tree tops bent and laughed in the breeze. After all, it
was June, and he was only sixteen, and the world was
young.</p>

<p>Aunt Emma looked up with startled eyes as he burst
into the house.</p>

<p>"Please!" he panted incoherently. "Will you&mdash;If
it isn't too late&mdash;I'm troop leader&mdash;A little something
to eat&mdash;hungry."</p>

<p>The puckered lines on Aunt Emma's forehead
smoothed magically. The boy could not be sick or
troubled if he wanted food. A hungry boy was altogether
normal. She bustled happily into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Bunny went straight to the telephone. When the
connection had been made, he said:</p>

<p>"Hello! Is Molly there?&mdash;Oh, is this you, Molly?
There's something I wanted to tell you. I couldn't
wait. I've been elected troop leader of all the Lakeville
Scouts&mdash;three whole patrols of them."</p>

<p>He waited a breathless second for her reply. But
when it came, he laughed aloud from sheer joy of living.
The Molly he had always known was talking to
him now. In one ecstatic sentence, she said she was
glad, and proud of him, and sure he would be the most
wonderful troop leader in the whole United States,
or anywhere else, for that matter; and wouldn't he go
riding in the car in the morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>His last trouble vanished into thin air, Bunny hung
up the receiver and faced Aunt Emma, who was heaping
the table with the most appetizing food he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>"I guess," he grinned, "I'm about the luckiest boy
in all the world."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you be?" asked practical Aunt
Emma.</p>
